When someone is confronted with a life threatening situation, they can develop unexpected capabilities. When a nerd is confronted with a life threatening situation, they read every last site on the web until they completely understand every last bit of the circumstance. I downloaded my 23andme raw data and poked at it with a text editor. I read cryptic articles about genetic engineering and installed the weird genome analysis tool “Promethease”, which can import, amongst other formats, 23andme raw data; but in contrast to 23andme it tells you even the very unnerving stuff. I tried to understand enough of genetic engineering to understand the source code of my own body. Someone had found a bug in me and I tried to reproduce it.

So, as someone who spends most of her waking hours either doing genetics or dancing (seriously guys this accounts for both of my jobs and my two biggest hobbies) you could say that this study is relevant to my interests. And when the first sentence in a paper is something as ridiculous and wonderful as “Dancing, which is integrally related to music, likely has its origins close to the birth of Homo sapiens, and throughout our history, dancing has been universally practiced in all societies,” you know that it’s going to be a trip. On the other hand, the reporting on this has been typically bad: talk about the findings that basically amounts to: dancers are more spiritual than other people, because genetics (I’m paraphrasing several articles). Unfortunatley, I can’t really blame the science writers for not really being able to understand what was going on in the article, since the original paper was, well, written by the kind of people who feel like they need to remind you that dancing and music are linked every time they mention dance or music, but don’t feel the need to specify whether the SLC6A4 HTTLPR allele is hyperactive, inactive, completely gone, or a unicorn. Feel free to find your way through the source material(hooray for PLoS and their lack of paywalls!). I’ve tried to give you some lamp-posts below the fold.

Dancing: Natural? It must be — he’s in a tree!
So in reality, they did two tests. The first one was genotyping dancers, athletes and non-dancer/non-athletes at a bunch of places in the genome. (Having just been surrounded by geneticists working in a very rich department I immediately thought ‘why didn’t they just sequence everyone’s genome?’ but we won’t go there for now.) And this was very frustrating for me because they present tables of p-values but their raw data is very well hidden away or not reported at all. So all I have to go on is what they say, I actually can’t look at the numbers and get a sense of them myself. They found that the dancers were more likely to have a certain allele of a gene called SLC6A4, which transports seratonin. A “long” allele of SLC6A4 means more transporter, more efficient seratonin uptake, and less seratonin at the synapse. A “short” allele of SLC6A4 means less transporter, and more seratonin at the synapse. Dancers, in general, were surprisingly likely to have a “short” allele, and this means dancers, in general, had more seratonin.

Similarly, they checked a related gene called AVPR1a, which is a receptor for vasopressin. They try to link this gene to social communication, but the data is kind of dodgy and in animals. But there’s some kind of hand-wavy seratonin and vasopressin are related thing going on, and again dancers were more likely than athletes to have certain alleles of AVPR1a, so maybe there’s something going on there too.
That’s where the genetics ends. And I’d like you to note that none of this is anything more than correlative, as with just about every genetic study in humans. All we can say is that in general, overall, dancers are more likely than non-dancer athletes to have certain alleles of certain genes which probably result in more serotonin at the synapse, and maybe something different in how they process vasopressin as well.

Dancing, which is integrally related to music, likely has its origins close to the birth of Homo sapiens, and throughout our history, dancing has been universally practiced in all societies. We hypothesized that there are differences among individuals in aptitude, propensity, and need for dancing that may partially be based on differences in common genetic polymorphisms. Identifying such differences may lead to an understanding of the neurobiological basis of one of mankind's most universal and appealing behavioral traits—dancing. In the current study, 85 current performing dancers and their parents were genotyped for the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4: promoter region HTTLPR and intron 2 VNTR) and the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a: promoter microsatellites RS1 and RS3). We also genotyped 91 competitive athletes and a group of nondancers/nonathletes (n = 872 subjects from 414 families). Dancers scored higher on the Tellegen Absorption Scale, a questionnaire that correlates positively with spirituality and altered states of consciousness, as well as the Reward Dependence factor in Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, a measure of need for social contact and openness to communication. Highly significant differences in AVPR1a haplotype frequencies (RS1 and RS3), especially when conditional on both SLC6A4 polymorphisms (HTTLPR and VNTR), were observed between dancers and athletes using the UNPHASED program package (Cocaphase: likelihood ratio test [LRS] = 89.23, p = 0.000044). Similar results were obtained when dancers were compared to nondancers/nonathletes (Cocaphase: LRS = 92.76, p = 0.000024). These results were confirmed using a robust family-based test (Tdtphase: LRS = 46.64, p = 0.010). Association was also observed between Tellegen Absorption Scale scores and AVPR1a (Qtdtphase: global chi-square = 26.53, p = 0.047), SLC6A4 haplotypes (Qtdtphase: chi-square = 2.363, p = 0.018), and AVPR1a conditional on SCL6A4 (Tdtphase: LRS = 250.44, p = 0.011). Similarly, significant association was observed between Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire Reward Dependence scores and AVPR1a RS1 (chi-square = 20.16, p = 0.01). Two-locus analysis (RS1 and RS3 conditional on HTTLPR and VNTR) was highly significant (LRS = 162.95, p = 0.001). Promoter repeat regions in the AVPR1a gene have been robustly demonstrated to play a role in molding a range of social behaviors in many vertebrates and, more recently, in humans. Additionally, serotonergic neurotransmission in some human studies appears to mediate human religious and spiritual experiences. We therefore hypothesize that the association between AVPR1a and SLC6A4 reflects the social communication, courtship, and spiritual facets of the dancing phenotype rather than other aspects of this complex phenotype, such as sensorimotor integration.

Synopsis

Dancing, integrally related to music, likely has its origins close to the birth of Homo sapiens. The authors hypothesized that there are differences in aptitude, propensity, and need for dancing that may be based on differences in common genetic polymorphisms. Identifying such differences may lead to an understanding of the neurobiological basis of dancing.

Variants of the serotonin transporter and the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a genes were examined in performing dancers, elite athletes, and nonathletes/nondancers. The serotonin transporter regulates the level of serotonin, a brain transmitter that contributes to spiritual experience. The vasopressin receptor has been shown in many animal studies to modulate social communication and affiliative behaviors. Notably, dancers scored high on the Tellegen Absorption Scale, a correlate of spirituality, and the Reward Dependence factor in Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, a measure of empathy, social communication, and need for social contact. Significant differences were observed in allele frequencies for both genes when dancers were compared to athletes as well as to nondancers/nonathletes. These two genes were also associated with scores on the Tellegen Absorption Scale and Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire Reward Dependence, suggesting that the association between these genes and dance is mediated by personality factors reflecting the social communication, courtship, and spiritual facets of the dancing phenotype.

<entry [Mon 2013:12:02 19:38:42 EST] AUTHENTICATION>

https://api.23andme.com/docs/authentication/

Authenticating with the API

You're building a genetic app. How do you get a user's data? With OAuth 2.0,

Ask the user's permission for their data. If they accept, you get an authorization code.
Exchange the code for an authorization token.
Using the token, call our API endpoints for data.
1. Ask the user's permission, get an authorization code
In your app, send the user to https://api.23andme.com/authorize/ with these parameters:

redirect_uri	The redirect uri from your dashboard, e.g. https://exampleapp.com/receive_code/.
response_type	code
client_id	The client id from your dashboard.
scope	A space-delimited list of scopes you're asking the user to allow you to access. See scopes for a list of them.
state	An optional value of your choosing, to maintain state between the request and the callback.
We recommend you use a branded button so users recognize the login, but you may also use a GET link, or even a form that POSTs to /authorize/ (helpful for scopes with thousands of rsids that won't fit in a URL string).

<!--

<a href="https://api.23andme.com/authorize/?redirect_uri=https://exampleapp.com/receive_code/&response_type=code&client_id=8c5bc3cd41932f405c80612248b7ae43&scope=basic rs123">Connect with 23andMe</a>

-->

When the user clicks the button, they login with 23andMe and see a screen asking them to give you access to their data. If they accept, their browser will redirect to your redirect_uri with parameter code=zzz. That's your authorization code, and it only lasts for 10 minutes.

2. Exchange the auth code for a token
Send a POST /token/ request with these parameters (client_id and client_secret are on your dashboard):

curl https://api.23andme.com/token/
     -d client_id=xxx \
     -d client_secret=yyy \
     -d grant_type=authorization_code \
     -d code=zzz \
     -d "redirect_uri=https://localhost:5000/receive_code/"
     -d "scope=basic%20rs3094315"

If successful, you'll get a 200 JSON response like this:

{"access_token":"89822b93d2",
 "token_type":"bearer",
 "expires_in": 86400,
 "refresh_token":"33c53cd7bb",
 "scope":"rs3094315 basic"}
Otherwise, you'll get a non-200 error response. Here's a full list of errors.

{"error_description":"No such code: 1928789",
 "error":"invalid_request"}
3. Call the API endpoints
Now that you've got a token, call the endpoints you want data from. See the API reference for endpoints and explanations.

Refresh tokens
Access tokens expire after 1 day. If you need to access a user's data past that, you can request another token using the last refresh_token that you were issued. Using the refresh token means you don't have to send the user through the "Accept" screen all over again. Requesting a new token set will invalidate your old refresh_token. Be sure to specify the full scope when requesting a new access token.

curl https://api.23andme.com/token/ \
     -d client_id=xxx \
     -d client_secret=yyy \
     -d grant_type=refresh_token \
     -d refresh_token=33c53cd7bb \
     -d "redirect_uri=https://localhost:5000/receive_code/" \
     -d "scope=basic%20rs3094315"

You will get the same JSON responses as when you got the original token.

Scopes
With OAuth 2.0, you include a space-delimited list of scopes in your requests to access certain user data. The user must consent to each scope. For example, if you wanted SNPs rs123 and rs456, and a user's health reports, your scope would be rs123 rs456 analyses.

scope	what it grants access to, and what the user sees when you ask for it
genomes	Your entire genome for all of your profiles. This all SNP locations, except those you haven't opted into. If you accept, a third party will have a copy of all your profiles' complete genetic data. You should only click accept for institutions you trust.
basic	Whether each profile in your account is genotyped.
names	The full name on your account and every profile in your account.
haplogroups	Your maternal and paternal haplogroups for all your profiles.
ancestry	Your ancestral breakdown for all of your profiles. Includes your Neanderthal ancestry.
relatives	Your relatives who have been genotyped with 23andMe.
relatives:write	The ability to add notes and update relationships for relative matches found by 23andMe.
analyses	Your analyzed genome (not raw genetic data). That includes all of your health and disease risks, drug sensitivities, your traits, and your carrier status for diseases.
profile:read	View profile information, including your picture.
profile:write	Edit your profile information, including your picture.
publish	Publish your haplogroups, Neanderthal, ancestry composition, DNA Music, and other shareable feature results, so they are readable by anyone.
introduction:read	Read DNA Relatives introductions between you and any of your genetic matches.
introduction:write	Send DNA Relatives introductions to any of your genetic matches.
rsXX or iXX	Access to the genotype at rsXX or iXX for all the user's profiles. You can string these together to get access to multiple genes. This list of SNPs (29MB) shows which SNPs our customers are genotyped for; all of these SNPs are valid scopes.

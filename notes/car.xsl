<entry [Tue 2013:02:05 22:48:43 EST] PROCEDURE TO PURCHASE TOYOTA SIENNA>

Hi Dad,

I've just heard from Illumina - they want me to start next Monday! Which is great as I'll get paid twice in February hopefully (payday is every two weeks) so I can get the computer to you sooner. But also means I've only a few days to sort out the car as I'll leave on Saturday.

Here are the forms attached. Here's the procedure step-by-step:

1. Print out all 3 pages of the Toyota forms. Sign and date on each page where marked 'X'. On the third page (toyota-forms-3.jpg) you have to fill in all the details between the two 'X' marks.

2. Scan your license, making sure picture and numbers are legible

3. Email the four pages (3 form pages + license) to:

    Subject: Stuart Young / Yuching Chung Sienna LE purchase

4. Call/text/email me when you're done and I'll call him to follow up and make sure of the terms
If all is well (i.e., 0% rate on 36-month purchase), I'll ask him to FedEx the purchase papers so you'll receive them the next day.

5. If you can sign and FedEx them back the same day, Mario will receive them the next day.

6. Once he's received the signed papers, the car is ours!

7. Mario will arrange for the title in your name and to register the car in Texas (hopefully less than the 6% tax here in Florida)

8. I put you on my insurance (so we can drive the car) and pay off the car within a year but after 7 months to avoid $150 prepayment penalty

Thanks again for helping me out as always!

Love,

Stuart

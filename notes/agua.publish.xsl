Top Genetics and Genomics Journals
Next up, and probably most interesting to you readers, is the list of journals themed around genetics and genomics. Here, I required an impact score of at least 5, because there were far too many journals otherwise. I took out a couple of “Annual Reviews” journals that only publish once a year.

My personal opinion is that Nature Genetics and Genome Research are the two top journals specific to our field, and the impact factor seems to support that. Several of my favorite journals (PLoS Biology, AJHG, Genome Biology, PLoS Genetics) are right in the 8 to 10 range. There are many, many options for publishing your genetic or genomic research, so you really have no excuse to be sitting on something!

Top Technology and Informatics Journals
I would be remiss not to include another category of journals with a focus on technology, methods, or bioinformatics. For us methods developers, these are great places to send manuscripts.

Journal	ISSN	Impact Factor	5-Year Avg.	Articles	Influence
NAT BIOTECHNOL	1087-0156	23.27	28.16	84	12.95
NAT METHODS	1548-7091	19.28	20.45	128	11.15
BIOINFORMATICS	1367-4803	5.47	6.05	707	2.61
PLOS COMPUT BIOL	1553-734X	5.22	5.84	407	2.72
BRIEF BIOINFORM	1467-5463	5.20	7.75	65	2.86
BMC BIOINFORMAT	1471-2105	2.75	3.49	557	1.32
BMC BIOTECHNOL	1472-6750	2.35	3.08	126	0.92
Of course, Nature Biotechnology and Nature Methods have the highest impact factor, but the journal Bioinformatics (a popular venue for many NGS analysis tools) is at a respectable 5.47.

Other Top Genetics and Genomics Journals
What are some other high-impact journals that broadly accept genetics/genomics/NGS manuscripts? Feel free to leave me a comment.

     Where can I publish a small paper on my pipeline and methods?
    Greetings.
    
    I have some material for a simple and very small, but useful, paper (described below). However, I have no idea where to publish it because all the journals I know are quite "big" - e.g. Bioinformatics, PLoS Computational Biology, Genome Research.
    
    The paper is aimed at non-experts who work on my particular group of organisms or ones like it (medium-sized haploid and/or AT-rich genomes). The basis of the paper is that, using my results and shell scripted pipeline with a quick UNIX tutorial, any biologist can map and assess variants in a genome in way that is quick and light-weight and does not require the use of a web interface; they can do it like "real" bioinformaticians: fast, flexibly, and iteratively. 
    
    Basically, I have an assembled shell script that can be slightly modified for several different types of analyses, and outputs specially formatted results for what we would be looking for. The real trick is that it uses common tools (e.g. SAMtools, BFCtools) that are really for human (i.e. diploid and balanced AT) genomes and makes them effective tools for other organisms. I have tested all the different parameters and found the best ways to effectively find variants, which is different for these genomes from standard practices. There is nothing too revolutionary about this, but I definitely think it is a useful tool for people to set up their own pipelines and start to do the mapping in an intelligent way. 
    
    The work comes out of spending a year as a bioinformatics person and an experimental biologist at a medical research institution where people are really scared to work on a cluster or do anything command-line driven. I've taught the pipeline to plenty of people now and it seems to be working well.
    
    Apologies if this is not the correct forum to search for guidance on this topic, I will happily switch if someone directs me to the correct place. Cheers and thanks.

    PloS One might be a great place for this.
        
    
    I would check out some of the BioMed journals, there is a variety and one of them may fit your paper. A better choice might actually be a journal that focuses on the sorts of organisms your pipeline targets, as opposed to a Bioinformatics paper. This would make it more likely to be read by the sort of audience you indicated it is meant for.

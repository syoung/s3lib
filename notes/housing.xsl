Dear Sir/Madam,

Could I view the unit later today or tomorrow afternoon? Please let me know what time is convenient for you.

I am a professional (software), well-mannered, clean and reliable. I just moved to San Diego for work (Illumina) and am looking for a quiet, clean place. I am a non-smoker, vegetarian and have no pets.

You can also reach me on: 305-781-2286

Stuart

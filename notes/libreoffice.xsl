HOW TO SET FIGURES WITH AUTOMATIC NUMBERING

1. INSERT FRAME AND IMAGE
Insert -> Frame
-> insert picture and caption into the frame


2. WRITE FIGURE CAPTION

Write the caption text below the picture, leave space for Figure #


3. ADD FIGURE NUMBER

->Insert -> Fields -> Others -> Tab Variables
-> Click on ‘Number range’ in the left list. Now you see the predefined number ranges in the list in the middle. If you do not like ‘Illustration’, then define you own number range. For to do it write the name of the new number range into the field ‘Name’, and its start value in the field ‘value’.
-> Insert and then close the dialog

NB: Next time when you use the dialog, the new number range will be listed in the middle too. Then you only need to select it there and click ‘Insert’ immediately.

4. GROUP FIGURE WITH PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH

A caption should always stay at the picture. Therefore you have to set the property “Keep with next paragraph” in the first of the two paragraphs. Right click the paragraph and select the item ‘Paragraph’, then tab ‘Text flow’. Find the check box there.

To keep caption and picture together you can use a table with invisible borders as well. Such layout-table is useful too, if you have a small picture and want to write text at the right or left side of the picture.

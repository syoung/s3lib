http://linux.101hacks.com/unix/ldconfig/

What is ldconfig?

ldconfig is used to create, udpate and remove symbolic links for the current shared libraries based on the lib directories present in the /etc/ld.so.conf


3 ldconfig Examples

1. Display current libraries from the cache

This displays the list of directories and the libraries that are stored in the current cache. In the following example, it indicates that there are 916 libraries found in the cache file /etc/ld.so.cache, and it lists all of them below.

# ldconfig -p | head -5
916 libs found in cache `/etc/ld.so.cache'
	libzephyr.so.4 (libc6) => /usr/lib/libzephyr.so.4
	libzbar.so.0 (libc6) => /usr/lib/libzbar.so.0
	libz.so.1 (libc6) => /lib/libz.so.1
	libz.so (libc6) => /usr/lib/libz.so

 
2. Display libraries from every directory

Scans all the directories, and prints the directory name, and all the links that are created under it.

# ldconfig -v | head
/usr/lib/mesa:
	libGL.so.1 -> libGL.so.1.2
/usr/lib/i686-linux-gnu:
	liblouis.so.2 -> liblouis.so.2.2.0
/usr/lib/alsa-lib:
	libasound_module_ctl_oss.so -> libasound_module_ctl_oss.so
	libasound_module_ctl_bluetooth.so -> libasound_module_ctl_bluetooth.so
	libasound_module_pcm_bluetooth.so -> libasound_module_pcm_bluetooth.so
	libasound_module_pcm_vdownmix.so -> libasound_module_pcm_vdownmix.so
	libasound_module_rate_speexrate.so -> libasound_module_rate_speexrate_medium.so
The /etc/ld.so.conf has an include statement, which indicates that all the *.conf file under /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory should be considered.

# cat /etc/ld.so.conf
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
As you see below, there are multiple *.conf file located under this ld.so.conf.d directory. All of these files will be used.

# ls -1 /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
GL.conf
i486-linux-gnu.conf
i686-linux-gnu.conf
libasound2.conf
libc.conf
Sometimes when you do ldconfig -v, you might get the following error. This is because the directory referred by some of the *.conf file located under /etc/ld.so.conf.d is not valid, and contains directory names that doesn?t exist.

/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can't stat /lib/i486-linux-gnu: No such file or directory
/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can't stat /usr/lib/i486-linux-gnu: No such file or directory
/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can't stat /lib/i686-linux-gnu: No such file or directory
/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can't stat /lib64: No such file or directory
Note: You can either ignore these error mesages are remove those *.conf files from the /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory.

3. Inform System about the New Libraries

If you?ve installed a new program by compiling it from source, you might want to inform the system about the new libraries.

For example, let us assume that you?ve installed a program called dummy, which has all it?s libraries under /opt/dummy/lib directory.

The following example will update the links using only the directory /opt/dummy/lib. This doesn?t rebuilt the links by processing the /etc/ld.so.conf file. Please note that this doesn?t rebuild the cache. It just updates the link.

# ldconfig -n /opt/dummy/lib
Instead of the above, you can also add the ?/opt/dummy/lib? to /etc/ld.so.conf and do the following.

# vi /etc/ld.so.conf

# ldconfig

Syntax and Options

Syntax:

ldconfig [OPTION...]
Short Option	Long Option	Option Description
-v	?verbose	Indicates verbose mode. Prints current version number, name of each directory as it is scanned and links that are created.
-n		Process the directories that are specified from the command line. This doesn?t process the regular /usr/lib and lib directories. This also doesn?t process directories specified in the /etc/ld.so.conf. This option implies -N.
-N		This doesn?t rebuild the cache. Unless -X is also specified, links are still updated.
-X		This doesn?t update the links. Unless -N is also specified, the cache is still rebuilt.
-f		Use the specified config file instead of /etc/ld.so.conf.
-C		Use the specified cache instead of /etc/ld.so.cache.
-r		Change to and use root as the root directory.
-l		This is library mode, which manually links individual libraries.
-p	?print-cache	Print the lists of directories and candidate libraries stored in the current cache.
-c FORMAT	?format=FORMAT	Uses FORMAT for the cache file. Valid values for FORMAT: old, new and compat. compat is the default value.
-i	?ignore-aux-cache	Ignore auxiliary cache file.
-?	?help, ?usage	Display help
-V	?version	Display version number

PROBLEM

screen -S something

	Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check"

DIAGNOSIS

This is because another user (you) initiated the current terminal ? you probably did a sudo su into the user you are now trying to run screen as, right?

SOLUTION

Sign out and properly connect / sign in as the user you wish to use.

OR

Run script /dev/null to own the shell (more info over at Server Fault); then try screen again.

<entry [Fri 2014:06:27 17:10:45 EST] MULTI-LINE grep>

SUMMARY:

M-x customize-variable RET vc-follow-symlinks RET


http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3717772/regex-grep-for-multi-line-search-needed

Without the need to install the grep variant pcregrep, you can do multiline search with grep.

$ grep -Pzo "(?s)^(\s*)\N*main.*?{.*?^\1}" *.c
Explanation:

-P activate perl-regexp for grep (a powerful extension of regular extensions)

-z suppress newline at the end of line, subtituting it for null character. That is, grep knows where end of line is, but sees the input as one big line.

-o print only matching. Because we're using -z, the whole file is like a single big line, so if there is a match, the entire file would be printed; this way it won't do that.

In regexp:

(?s) activate PCRE_DOTALL, which means that . finds any character or newline

\N find anything except newline, even with PCRE_DOTALL activated

.*? find . in nongreedy mode, that is, stops as soon as possible.

^ find start of line

\1 backreference to first group (\s*) This is a try to find same indentation of method

As you can imagine, this search prints the main method in a C (*.c) source file.

Get UUID of Hard Disks
October 15, 2007 ? liquidat

The Universally Unique Identifier can be used to identify a device independent form its mount point or device name. This is more and more important as many devices today support hot-plugging or are external anyway. Therefore it makes sometimes sense to access a device (for example in fstab) not by device name but by the UUID.

There are several ways to get the UUID. The first one uses the /dev/ directory. While you are on is you might want to check other by-* directories, I never knew of them.
1
$
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 11. Okt 18:02 53cdad3b-4b01-4a6c-a099-be1cdf1acf6d -> ../../sda2
Another way to get the uuid by usage of the tool blkid:

$ blkid /dev/sda1
2

<entry [Fri 2012:11:30 15:55:27 EST] IDENTIFY YOUR FILESYSTEM TYPE (ext2, ext3, ext4, ETC.)>

http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/04/identify-file-system-type/

5 Methods to Identify Your Linux File System Type (Ext2 or Ext3 or Ext4)
by RAMESH NATARAJAN on APRIL 18, 2011
 

Question: How do I identify my file system type? I like to upgrade my current file system to the latest ext4. Before that I would like to know what my current file system type is for various mount points I have on my UNIX system.

Answer: Use any one of the five methods mentioned below to identify your file system type.

Method 1: Use df -T Command

The -T option in the df command displays the file system type.

# df -T | awk '{print $1,$2,$NF}' | grep "^/dev"
/dev/sda1 ext2 /
/dev/sdb1 ext3 /home
/dev/sdc1 ext3 /u01
Method 2: Use Mount Command

Use the mount command as shown below.

# mount | grep "^/dev"
/dev/sda1 on / type ext2 (rw)
/dev/sdb1 on /home type ext3 (rw)
/dev/sdc1 on /u01 type ext3 (rw)
As shown in the above example:

/dev/sda1 is ext2 file system type. (mounted as /)
/dev/sdb1 is ext3 file system type. (mounted as /home)
/dev/sdc1 is ext3 file system type. (mounted as /u01)
Method 3: Use file Command

As root, use the file command as shown below. You need to pass the individual device name to the file command.

# file -sL /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1: Linux rev 1.0 ext2 filesystem data (mounted or unclean) (large files)

# file -sL /dev/sdb1
/dev/sda1: Linux rev 1.0 ext3 filesystem data (needs journal recovery)(large files)

# file -sL /dev/sdc1
/dev/sda1: Linux rev 1.0 ext3 filesystem data (needs journal recovery)(large files)
Note: You should execute the file command as root user. If you execute as non-root user, you?ll still get some output. But, that will not display the file system type as shown below.


 
$ file -sL /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1: writable, no read permission
Method 4: View the /etc/fstab file

If a particular mount point is configured to be mounted automatically during system startup, you can identify its file system type by looking at the /etc/fstab file.

As shown in the example below, / is ext2, /home is ext3, and /u01 is ext3.

# cat /etc/fstab
LABEL=/r       /        ext2    defaults    1 1
LABEL=/home    /home    ext3    defaults    0 0
LABEL=/u01     /u01     ext3    defaults    0 0
Method 5: Use fsck Command

Execute the fsck command as shown below. This will display the file system type of a given device.

# fsck -N /dev/sda1
fsck 1.39 (29-May-2006)
[/sbin/fsck.ext2 (1) -- /] fsck.ext2 /dev/sda1

# fsck -N /dev/sdb1
fsck 1.39 (29-May-2006)
[/sbin/fsck.ext3 (1) -- /home] fsck.ext3 /dev/sdb1

# fsck -N /dev/sdc1
fsck 1.39 (29-May-2006)
[/sbin/fsck.ext3 (1) -- /u01] fsck.ext3 /dev/sdc1

<entry [Sat 2012:03:17 23:21:17 EST] SECURE DELETE FILES AND WIPE EMPTY SPACE>

SUMMARY

1. INSTALL SECURE DELETE
sudo aptitude install secure-delete

2. CLEAN MEMORY
srmem -v

3. WRITE OVER BLANK SPACE
sfill -v /

4. FIND SWAP LOCATION
cat /proc/swaps

5. DISABLE SWAP
sudo swapoff /dev/sda3

6. WIPE SWAP
sudo sswap /dev/sda3

7. REENABLE SWAP
sudo swapon /dev/sda3




The Secure-Delete tools are a particularly useful set of programs that use advanced techniques to permanently delete files. To install the Secure-Delete tools in Ubuntu, run the following command

sudo aptitude install secure-delete

The Secure-Delete package comes with the following commands

srm(Secure remove) - used for deleting files or directories currently on your hard disk.

smem(Secure memory wiper) - used to wipe traces of data from your computer?s memory (RAM).

sfill(Secure free space wiper) - used to wipe all traces of data from the free space on your disk.

sswap(Secure swap wiper) - used to wipe all traces of data from your swap partition.


srm - Secure remove

srm removes each specified file by overwriting, renaming, and truncat-ing it before unlinking. This prevents other people from undeleting  or recovering any information about the file from the command line.

srm,  like  every  program  that  uses the getopt function to parse its arguments, lets you use the -- option to indicate  that  all  arguments are non-options.  To remove a file called ?-f? in the current directory, you could type either ?srm -- -f? or ?srm ./-f?.

srm Syntax

srm [OPTION]? FILE?

Available Options

-d, --directory - ignored (for compatibility with rm)

-f, --force - ignore nonexistent files, never prompt

-i, --interactive - prompt before any removal

-r, -R, --recursive - remove the contents of directories recursively

-s, --simple - only overwrite with a single pass of random data

-m, --medium - overwrite the file with 7 US DoD compliant passes  (0xF6,0×00,0xFF,random,0×00,0xFF,random)

-z, --zero - after overwriting, zero blocks used by file

-n, --nounlink - overwrite file, but do not rename or unlink it

-v, --verbose - explain what is being done

--help display this help and exit

--version - output version information and exit

srm Examples

Delete a file using srm

srm myfile.txt

Delete a directory using srm

srm -r myfiles

smem - Secure memory wiper

smem is designed to delete data which may lie still in your memory (RAM) in a secure manner which can not be recovered by thiefs, law enforcement or other threats. Note that with the new SDRAMs, data will not wither away but will be kept static - it is easy to extract the necessary information! The wipe algorythm is based on the paper ?Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory? presented at the 6th Usenix Security Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of the leading civilian cryptographers.

smem Syntax

smem [-f] [-l] [-l] [-v]

Available Options

-f - fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom.

-l - lessens the security. Only two passes are written: the first with 0×00 and a final random one.

-l -l for a second time lessons the security even more: only one pass with 0×00 is written.

-v - verbose mode

sfill - secure free space wipe

sfill is designed to delete data which lies on available diskspace on mediums in a secure manner which can not be recovered by thiefs, law enforcement or other threats. The wipe algorythm is based on the paper ?Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory? presented at the 6th Usenix Security Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of the leading civilian cryptographers.

sfill Syntax

sfill [-f] [-i] [-I] [-l] [-l] [-v] [-z] directory/mountpoint

Available Option

-f - fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom, no synchronize mode.

-i - wipe only free inode space, not free disk space

-I -wipe only free disk space, not free inode space

-l -lessens the security. Only two passes are written: one mode with 0xff and a final mode with random values.

-l -l for a second time lessons the security even more: only one random pass is written.

-v - verbose mode

-z - wipes the last write with zeros instead of random data

directory/mountpoint this is the location of the file created in your filesystem. It should lie on the partition you want to write.

sswap - Secure swap wiper

sswap is designed to delete data which may lie still on your swapspace in a secure manner which can not be recovered by thiefs,  law  enforce?ment  or  other  threats.The  wipe  algorythm  is based on the paper ?Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic  and  Solid-State  Memory?  pre?sented  at  the  6th Usenix Security Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of the leading civilian cryptographers.

sswap Syntax

sswap [-f] [-l] [-l] [-v] [-z] swapdevice

Available Option

-f - fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom, no synchronize  mode.

-l - lessens the security. Only two passes are written: one mode with 0xff and a final mode with random values.

-l  -l for a second time lessons the security even  more:  only  one pass with random values is written.

-v - verbose mode

-z - wipes the last write with zeros instead of random data

sswap Examples

Before you start using sswap you must disable your swap partition.You can determine your mounted swap devices using the following command

cat /proc/swaps

Disable swap using the following command

sudo swapoff /dev/sda3

/dev/sda3 - This is my swap device

Once your swap device is disabled, you can wipe it with sswipe using the following command

sudo sswap /dev/sda3

After completing the above command you need to re-enable swap using the following command

sudo swapon /dev/sda3

Other Tool

DBAN

Darik?s Boot and Nuke (?DBAN?) is a self-contained boot disk that securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.

<entry [Tue 2011:11:29 13:58:20 EST] INCREASE BUFFER IN screen>


http://www.samsarin.com/blog/2007/03/11/gnu-screen-working-with-the-scrollback-buffer/

he number of scrollback lines can be configured in your $HOME/.screenrc file, by adding the following line:

defscrollback 5000
This sets the scrollback to 5000 lines.

You can also override this default value when starting screen using the -h [num] option, where num is the number of scrollback lines.

Finally, if you want to change the number of lines of scrollback for a single window, using the ?scrollback? command. Hit C-a (Ctrl-A) : to go to the Screen command line and type scrollback num, where num is the number of scrollback lines.

You can check the number of scrollback lines in your window. Hit C-a i to display window information. You will see a status line with information similar to the following:

(27,42)/(186,42)+20 +flow UTF-8 3(bash)
In this case, my scrollback is 20 lines (it is displayed as +20 in the output above).

Entering Scrollback Mode and Navigating
To enter scrollback hit C-a [. A status line will indicate that you've entered copy mode. To exit scrollback mode, hit the escape button.

Navigating in scrollback mode will be pretty familiar to VI users. Here are some of the most common navigation keys (taken from the screen manpage):

h -    Move the cursor left by one character
j -    Move the cursor down by one line
k -    Move the cursor up by one line
l -    Move the cursor right by one character
0 -    Move to the beginning of the current line
$ -    Move to the end of the current line.
G -    Moves to the specified line 
       (defaults to the end of the buffer).
C-u -  Scrolls a half page up.
C-b -  Scrolls a full page up.
C-d -  Scrolls a half page down.
C-f -  Scrolls the full page down.

I often use the page up and page down commands to quickly scroll back through the window's history.

In addition to traditional navigation, Screen allows you to search the scrollback buffer using the following commands:

/ -    Search forward
? -    Search backward
Search is a very useful feature. For example, you could run a script and search for keywords in the output (such as Error), without having to redirect the output.

Copy and Paste
Scrollback mode is also know as copy mode and it allows you to copy any section of text into a copy buffer. To copy text, move the cursor to the start of the text you want to copy, hit spacebar, move the cursor to the end of the text you want to copy (Screen will highlight the text to be copied as you move), and again hit spacebar. Screen will indicate the number of characters copied into the copy buffer.

To paste text, simply hit C-a ].

Copying to the Mac Clipboard
While copying and pasting in a terminal is very useful, I also find that I often want to copy some text from a terminal into my clipboard. This next tip will show you how to do this for Mac OSX, but I'm sure it can be easily modified to work with other operating systems.

Open $HOME/.screenrc and add the following line:

bind b eval "writebuf" "exec sh -c 'pbcopy < /tmp/screen-exchange'"
This line tells Screen to write its copy buffer to a temporary file (defaults to /tmp/screen-exchange), and then sends that file to pbcopy, a Mac OSX utility that copies text into the Mac clipboard. In this case, I?ve bound the command to C-a b, but you can change to best suit your own environment.

Conclusion
This wraps up my review of Screen?s scrollback buffer. I hope this tutorial is useful, especially to those that frequently work in terminal windows.

<entry [Wed 2011:10:26 12:05:53 EST] THE CHROOT, ENV AND TIMEOUT UTILITIES>

23.1 `chroot': Run a command with a different root directory
============================================================

`chroot' runs a command with a specified root directory.  On many
systems, only the super-user can do this.(1) Synopses:

     chroot OPTION NEWROOT [COMMAND [ARGS]...]
     chroot OPTION

   Ordinarily, file names are looked up starting at the root of the
directory structure, i.e., `/'.  `chroot' changes the root to the
directory NEWROOT (which must exist) and then runs COMMAND with
optional ARGS.  If COMMAND is not specified, the default is the value
of the `SHELL' environment variable or `/bin/sh' if not set, invoked
with the `-i' option.  COMMAND must not be a special built-in utility
(*note Special built-in utilities::).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *note Common
options::.  Options must precede operands.

`--userspec=USER[:GROUP]'
     By default, COMMAND is run with the same credentials as the
     invoking process.  Use this option to run it as a different USER
     and/or with a different primary GROUP.


`--groups=GROUPS'
     Use this option to specify the supplementary GROUPS to be used by
     the new process.  The items in the list (names or numeric IDs)
     must be separated by commas.


   Here are a few tips to help avoid common problems in using chroot.
To start with a simple example, make COMMAND refer to a statically
linked binary.  If you were to use a dynamically linked executable, then
you'd have to arrange to have the shared libraries in the right place
under your new root directory.

   For example, if you create a statically linked `ls' executable, and
put it in `/tmp/empty', you can run this command as root:

     $ chroot /tmp/empty /ls -Rl /

   Then you'll see output like this:

     /:
     total 1023
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 1041745 Aug 16 11:17 ls

   If you want to use a dynamically linked executable, say `bash', then
first run `ldd bash' to see what shared objects it needs.  Then, in
addition to copying the actual binary, also copy the listed files to
the required positions under your intended new root directory.
Finally, if the executable requires any other files (e.g., data, state,
device files), copy them into place, too.

   Exit status:

     125 if `chroot' itself fails
     126 if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked
     127 if COMMAND cannot be found
     the exit status of COMMAND otherwise

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) However, some systems (e.g., FreeBSD) can be configured to allow
certain regular users to use the `chroot' system call, and hence to run
this program.  Also, on Cygwin, anyone can run the `chroot' command,
because the underlying function is non-privileged due to lack of
support in MS-Windows.



23.2 `env': Run a command in a modified environment
===================================================

`env' runs a command with a modified environment.  Synopses:

     env [OPTION]... [NAME=VALUE]... [COMMAND [ARGS]...]
     env

   Operands of the form `VARIABLE=VALUE' set the environment variable
VARIABLE to value VALUE.  VALUE may be empty (`VARIABLE=').  Setting a
variable to an empty value is different from unsetting it.  These
operands are evaluated left-to-right, so if two operands mention the
same variable the earlier is ignored.

   Environment variable names can be empty, and can contain any
characters other than `=' and ASCII NUL.  However, it is wise to limit
yourself to names that consist solely of underscores, digits, and ASCII
letters, and that begin with a non-digit, as applications like the
shell do not work well with other names.

   The first operand that does not contain the character `=' specifies
the program to invoke; it is searched for according to the `PATH'
environment variable.  Any remaining arguments are passed as arguments
to that program.  The program should not be a special built-in utility
(*note Special built-in utilities::).

   Modifications to `PATH' take effect prior to searching for COMMAND.
Use caution when reducing `PATH'; behavior is not portable when `PATH'
is undefined or omits key directories such as `/bin'.

   In the rare case that a utility contains a `=' in the name, the only
way to disambiguate it from a variable assignment is to use an
intermediate command for COMMAND, and pass the problematic program name
via ARGS.  For example, if `./prog=' is an executable in the current
`PATH':

     env prog= true # runs 'true', with prog= in environment
     env ./prog= true # runs 'true', with ./prog= in environment
     env -- prog= true # runs 'true', with prog= in environment
     env sh -c '\prog= true' # runs 'prog=' with argument 'true'
     env sh -c 'exec "$@"' sh prog= true # also runs 'prog='

   If no command name is specified following the environment
specifications, the resulting environment is printed.  This is like
specifying the `printenv' program.

   For some examples, suppose the environment passed to `env' contains
`LOGNAME=rms', `EDITOR=emacs', and `PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks':

   * Output the current environment.
          $ env | LC_ALL=C sort
          EDITOR=emacs
          LOGNAME=rms
          PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks

   * Run `foo' with a reduced environment, preserving only the original
     `PATH' to avoid problems in locating `foo'.
          env - PATH="$PATH" foo

   * Run `foo' with the environment containing `LOGNAME=rms',
     `EDITOR=emacs', and `PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks', and guarantees that
     `foo' was found in the file system rather than as a shell built-in.
          env foo

   * Run `nemacs' with the environment containing `LOGNAME=foo',
     `EDITOR=emacs', `PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks', and `DISPLAY=gnu:0'.
          env DISPLAY=gnu:0 LOGNAME=foo nemacs

   * Attempt to run the program `/energy/--' (as that is the only
     possible path search result); if the command exists, the
     environment will contain `LOGNAME=rms' and `PATH=/energy', and the
     arguments will be `e=mc2', `bar', and `baz'.
          env -u EDITOR PATH=/energy -- e=mc2 bar baz


   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *note Common
options::.  Options must precede operands.

`-0'
`--null'
     Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather
     than a newline. This option enables other programs to parse the
     output of `env' even when that output would contain data with
     embedded newlines.
    
`-u NAME'
`--unset=NAME'
     Remove variable NAME from the environment, if it was in the
     environment.

`-'
`-i'
`--ignore-environment'
     Start with an empty environment, ignoring the inherited
     environment.


   Exit status:

     0   if no COMMAND is specified and the environment is output
     125 if `env' itself fails
     126 if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked
     127 if COMMAND cannot be found
     the exit status of COMMAND otherwise



23.7 `timeout': Run a command with a time limit
===============================================

`timeout' runs the given COMMAND and kills it if it is still running
after the specified time interval.  Synopsis:

     timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...

   COMMAND must not be a special built-in utility (*note Special
built-in utilities::).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *note Common
options::.  Options must precede operands.

`-k DURATION'
`--kill-after=DURATION'
     Ensure the monitored COMMAND is killed by also sending a `KILL'
     signal, after the specified DURATION.  Without this option, if the
     selected signal proves not to be fatal, `timeout' does not kill
     the COMMAND.

`-s SIGNAL'
`--signal=SIGNAL'
     Send this SIGNAL to COMMAND on timeout, rather than the default
     `TERM' signal. SIGNAL may be a name like `HUP' or a number. Also
     see *Note Signal specifications::.

   DURATION is an integer followed by an optional unit:
     `s' for seconds (the default)
     `m' for minutes
     `h' for hours
     `d' for days
   A duration of 0 disables the associated timeout.

   Exit status:

     124 if COMMAND times out
     125 if `timeout' itself fails
     126 if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked
     127 if COMMAND cannot be found
     the exit status of COMMAND otherwise

OTHER LINUX

2. SUDO FOR FILE SYSTEMS

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sudoers


Simple /etc/sudoers Examples

This section presents some simple examples of how to do many commonly required tasks using the sudo utility.
Granting All Access to Specific Users
You can grant users bob and bunny full access to all privileged commands, with this sudoers entry.
bob, bunny  ALL=(ALL) ALL

This is generally not a good idea because this allows bob and bunny to use the su command to grant themselves permanent root privileges thereby bypassing the command logging features of sudo. The example on using aliases in the sudoers file shows how to eliminate this prob


Granting Access To Specific Users To Specific Files

This entry allows user peter and all the members of the group operator to gain access to all the program files in the /sbin and /usr/sbin directories, plus the privilege of running the command /usr/local/apps/check.pl. Notice how the trailing slash (/) is required to specify a directory location:
peter, %operator ALL= /sbin/, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/apps/check.pl
Notice also that the lack of any username entries within parentheses () after the = sign prevents the users from running the commands automatically masquerading as another user. This is explained further in the next example.


Granting Access to Specific Files as Another User

The sudo -u entry allows allows you to execute a command as if you were another user, but first you have to be granted this privilege in the sudoers file.
This feature can be convenient for programmers who sometimes need to kill processes related to projects they are working on. For example, programmer peter is on the team developing a financial package that runs a program called monthend as user accounts. From time to time the application fails, requiring "peter" to stop it with the /bin/kill, /usr/bin/kill or /usr/bin/pkill commands but only as user "accounts". The sudoers entry would look like this:

peter ALL=(accounts) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/kill, /usr/bin/pkill

User peter is allowed to stop the monthend process with this command:


[peter@bigboy peter]# sudo -u accounts pkill monthend


Granting Access Without Needing Passwords
This example allows all users in the group operator to execute all the commands in the /sbin directory without the need for entering a password. This has the added advantage of being more convenient to the user:

%operator ALL= NOPASSWD: /sbin/


Using Aliases in the sudoers File

Sometimes you'll need to assign random groupings of users from various departments very similar sets of privileges. The sudoers file allows users to be grouped according to function with the group and then being assigned a nickname or alias which is used throughout the rest of the file. Groupings of commands can also be assigned aliases too.
In the next example, users peter, bob and bunny and all the users in the operator group are made part of the user alias ADMINS. All the command shell programs are then assigned to the command alias SHELLS. Users ADMINS are then denied the option of running any SHELLS commands and su:
Cmnd_Alias    SHELLS = /usr/bin/sh,  /usr/bin/csh, \
                       /usr/bin/ksh, /usr/local/bin/tcsh, \
                       /usr/bin/rsh, /usr/local/bin/zsh
 
 
User_Alias    ADMINS = peter, bob, bunny, %operator
ADMINS        ALL    = !/usr/bin/su, !SHELLS


This attempts to ensure that users don't permanently su to become root, or enter command shells that bypass sudo's command logging. It doesn't prevent them from copying the files to other locations to be run. The advantage of this is that it helps to create an audit trail, but the restrictions can be enforced only as part of the company's overall security policy.


Other Examples
You can view a comprehensive list of /etc/sudoers file options by issuing the command man sudoers.


Using syslog To Track All sudo Commands

All sudo commands are logged in the log file /var/log/messages which can be very helpful in determining how user error may have contributed to a problem. All the sudo log entries have the word sudo in them, so you can easily get a thread of commands used by using the grep command to selectively filter the output accordingly.
Here is sample output from a user bob failing to enter their correct sudo password when issuing a command, immediately followed by the successful execution of the command /bin/more sudoers.

[root@bigboy tmp]# grep sudo /var/log/messages
Nov 18 22:50:30 bigboy sudo(pam_unix)[26812]: authentication failure; logname=bob uid=0 euid=0 tty=pts/0 ruser= rhost= user=bob
Nov 18 22:51:25 bigboy sudo: bob : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/etc ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/more sudoers


Conclusion

It is important to know how to add users, not just so they can log in to our system. Most server based applications usually run via a dedicated unprivileged user account, for example the MySQL database application runs as user mysql and the Apache Web server application runs as user apache. These accounts aren't always created automatically, especially if the software is installed using TAR files.
Finally, the sudo utility provides a means of dispersing the responsibility of systems management to multiple users. You can even give some groups of users only partial access to privileged commands depending on their roles in the organization. This makes sudo a valuable part of any company's server administration and security policy.

<entry [Thu 2011:06:16 04:52:13 EST] FIXED CRONTAB>

PROBLEM:

CRON SEEMS TO BE CORRECTLY CONFIGURED:
crontab -l

* *     * * *   root    /agua/0.6/bin/scripts/checkBalancers.pl > /tmp/loadbalancers.out

BUT GET NO OUTPUT:

cat /tmp/loadbalancers.out

AND GET THIS ERROR:

tail /var/log/syslog
Jun 16 04:45:01 Satellite-L355 CRON[3792]: (root) CMD (root    /agua/0.6/bin/scripts/checkBalancers.pl > /tmp/loadbalancers.out)
Jun 16 04:45:01 Satellite-L355 CRON[3791]: (CRON) error (grandchild #3792 failed with exit status 127)
Jun 16 04:45:01 Satellite-L355 CRON[3791]: (CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)


DIAGNOSIS:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cron/+bug/151231

I'm guessing that what's going on here is this: cron starts the job with the output piped (probably indirectly) into mail. However, 'mail' doesn't exist, as I haven't installed it, so the pipe isn't created properly. However, as the output is buffered, everything continues normally until the job has produced enough output to fill the buffer. The operating system tries to write the buffer into the (broken) pipe and fails (with a signal?) which terminates the process. If little or no output is produced by the job, the buffer flush doesn't happen until the process is terminating, so from the user's point of view, it terminates normally.

Part of the usual cron-generated email contains the command executed. Consequently, for a longer command there is less space left in the unflushed buffer so less output is required from the process before it fails.

**Suggestions**

If my speculation is correct, there seem to be two main options:

  1) cron should check whether its call to the 'mail' program succeeded, and if not, simply discard the job's output, or
  2) mail should be made a prerequisite for the cron package.

For a small machine, like mine, I'm not planning to install any more packages than strictly necessary, so I'd prefer option 1). This way, cron jobs would run reliably, it's just that I wouldn't get mail notifications with output, errors, and so on.

:: WORKAROUND ::
define MAILTO to empty (MAILTO="") at the beginning of the crontab .


SOLUTION:

use MAILTO='':

crontab -l

* *     * * *   root    export MAILTO=""; /agua/0.6/bin/scripts/checkBalancers.pl > /tmp/loadbalancers.out


... AND CRON RUNS FINE:

cat /tmp/loadbalancers.out

xargs
-----
ls -1 | grep -v "^.kde$" | xargs -n 1 -iHERE cp -R HERE destination

Basically, 'ls -1' gets all the contents of the directory, grep removes an entry of ".kde", and then xargs copies everything else.


cp
--
cp *?[!php] /home/SOURCE/ /home/COPIED/

With this command in the bash you can copy all files except php from a directory.

<entry [Fri 2011:04:22 15:31:00 EST] FLUSH COMMANDS TO AND DISABLE WRITING TO .bash_history>

CLEAR ANY EXISTING .bash_history AND PREVENT ANY FURTHER WRITING TO .bash_history:

export HISTSIZE=0
export HISTFILESIZE=0

How do you set these options? Either export them in your environment in your personal bash configuration file (~/.bashrc) or in the global bash configuration file (/etc/bash.bashrc). The name of the configuration files can depend from your Linux distribution and bash version (the ones included are from Debian Linux), but you can always see your particular options using man bash. So, you can add in your configuration files the parameters you want like this:
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
export HISTSIZE=500


USE history -a TO FLUSH COMMANDS IN CURRENT SESSION TO .bash_history

QUESTION: I often run several terms, each of which keep an individual bash history. If I close them all, and reopen, I lose all but one of the histories. Is there some way to restore or merge the histories from multiple terminals?

ANSWER:

The commands are kept in a memory buffer and are normally written to the history file only on the session exit.

USE history -a

TO append the new history lines (history lines entered since the beginning of the current Bash session) to the history file.


ALSO:

history -c (clear the history)
history -w (write to the file ? overwrite!)


PREVENT SAVING DUPLICATE LINES:
http://www.ducea.com/2006/05/15/linux-tips-take-control-of-your-bash_history/

ANSWER:

My /etc/crontab (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3) looks like this:

# M is minute to start: 00 - 59
# H is hour to start; 00 - 23
# D is day of month to start: 01 - 31
# m is month to start: 01 - 12 -- 01 is January, etc.
# d is day of week to start: 00 - 06 -- 00 is Sunday, etc.

# run-parts
# cron.daily is run Monday - Saturday.
# cron.weekly is run Sunday only.

#M H D m d user program arguments
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
04 1 * * 1-6 root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
04 3 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
19 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

So let us look at /etc/cron.daily...

[/etc/cron.daily]$ ls -l
total 48
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 379 Dec 18 2006 0anacron
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 39 May 22 2008 0logwatch ->

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 296 Dec 3 01:39 rpm
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 100 Nov 2 2007 tetex.cron
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 328 Aug 26 2008 tmpwatch
-rwxr-xr-- 1 root root 2629 Mar 16 05:44 zBackup.cron

Now if I look in mlocate.cron, I observe...

[/etc/cron.daily]$ cat mlocate.cron
#!/bin/sh
nodevs=$(< /proc/filesystems awk '$1 == "nodev" { print $2 }')
renice +19 -p $$ >/dev/null 2>&1
/usr/bin/updatedb -f "$nodevs"

So on my system it runs a little after 01:04 everyday.

<entry [Tue Nov 30 11:28:29 EST 2010] BASH SHELL EMACS EDITING>




Bash Emacs Editing Mode Cheat Sheet
http://www.catonmat.net/blog/bash-emacs-editing-mode-cheat-sheet

  
When you are working in a shell you certainly don't want to waste your time using arrow keys or home/end keys to navigate around the command line. One of the most popular shells, bash - Bourne Again SHell, uses GNU's Readline library for reading the command line.

The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. The readline library also includes functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands. Both emacs and vi editing modes are available.

I have mastered both of the editing modes and have created cheat sheets for both of them (and a tiny separate one for readline's history expansion).

This is a cheat sheet for the default, emacs, editing mode.

Here are a few examples with screenshots on how to use this editing mode.

Let '[]' be the position of cursor in all the examples.

Example 1: movement basics

Suppose you are at the end of the line and want to move 3 words backwards.

$ echo word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6[]
If you hit M-3 followed by M-b, you would end up exactly where you wanted:

$ echo word1 word2 word3 []word4 word5 word6
An alternative is to hit M-b three times in a row: M-b M-b M-b

If you look up on the cheat sheet what M-3 does, it sets the numeric-argument to 3 which in this case acts as a counter how many times should M-b command be repeated. The M-b command calls backward-word function which does the obvious.

The numeric-argument can also be negative, which makes the argument to be applied in the opposite direction.

Other shortcuts of interest are M-f to move forward and C-a, and C-e to move to the beginning and end of line.

Example 2: command history

Suppose you used a pretty complex command a while ago and now you remember just a few arguments of this command. You want to find this command and call it with a few arguments modified.

If you hit C-r readline will put you in an incremental reverse history search mode. Typing a part of the arguments you remember, will locate the previously executed command matching the typed text. Hitting C-r again will locate any other command which matches your typed text.

To put the found command on command line for editing hit C-j.

Example 3: completing

Suppose you want to quickly list all the users on the system.

Hit C-x ~ and read-line will attempt username completion and output all the usernames to the terminal.

$ []
adm        catonmat   ftp        halt       mailnull   nobody     root       smmsp      vcsa
apache     cpanel     games      lp         mysql      nscd       rpc        sshd
bin        daemon     gopher     mail       named      operator   rpm        sync
cat        dbus       haldaemon  mailman    news       picurls    shutdown   uucp
$ []
Suppose you now want to quickly list all the users on the system starting with 'm'. You can type 'm' followed by the same C-x ~ to do that.

$ m[]
mail      mailman   mailnull  mysql
$ m[]
The other interesting completions are:

C-x / which lists possible filename completion,
C-x $ which lists possible bash variable completion,
C-x @ which lists possible hostname completion and,
C-x ! which lists possible command completion.
and

Meta-/ which does filename completion,
Meta-$ which does bash variable completion,
Meta-@ which does hostname completion and,
Meta-! which does command completion.
Example 3: killing and yanking

Suppose you have to type a-long-word-like-this a couple of times.

The easiest way to do this is to kill the word, which puts it into the kill ring. Contents of the kill ring can be accessed by yanking.

For example, type 'a-long-word-like-this' in the shell:

$ command a-long-word-like-this []
Now press C-w to kill one word backward:

$ command []
Press C-y to yank (paste) the word as many times as you wish (I pressed it 3 times here:)

$ command a-long-word-like-this a-long-word-like-this a-long-word-like-this []
The kill ring does not contain just the one latest killing. It can be filled with a number of kills and rotated with M-y shortcut.

Another example:

Suppose you typed a longer command and you noticed that part of the THE TEXT GOT TYPED IN CAPITAL LETTERS. Without knowing the readline shortcuts you would erase the text and probably type it again. Now you can use the readline keyboard shortcuts and change the case very, very quickly.

You can use the following shortcuts to accomplish this:

1) M-l (Meta-l (on your computer, probably ESC-l)) shortcut is bound to readline's downcase-word function which lowercases the current word.
2) M-b shortcut is bound to readline's backward-word function which moves the cursor one word backwards.
3) M-<number> shortcut is bound to readline's numeric-argument function which in some cases acts as how many times should the following command be repeated.

Here is a real word example, suppose we have typed the following ([] is the cursor):

$ echo the text. THE TEXT GOT TYPED IN CAPITAL LETTERS[]
To get to the beginning of 'THE' we might repetitively hit M-b seven times or we could set the numeric argument to seven by typing M-7 and then hit M-b once.

After doing this the cursor would have moved before the word 'THE':

$ echo the text. []THE TEXT GOT TYPED IN CAPITAL LETTERS
Now, by setting the numerical argument to 7 again and by pressing M-l or by pressing M-l seven times, we turn the text all in lower case.

$ echo the text. the text got typed in capital letters[]
Actually what we did in this example was not as efficient as it could have been. The numeric-argument shortcut accepts negative arguments which turn the direction of the following command in other direction. We could have turned the text in lower case by hitting M--7 and M-l

If you really want to be more productive, I suggest you play around with the commands in the cheat sheet for a while.
My previous article on being more productive on the command line was screen's cheat sheet which allows to emulate multiple terminals in a single window. You can take a look at it as well!

CHANGE HOSTNAME
---------------

echo newhostname > /proc/sys/kernel/hostname

or

sysctl kernel.hostname=NEW_HOSTNAME

and edit /etc/sysconfig/network to set HOSTNAME to the value you need

see here

http://www.ducea.com/2006/08/07/how-to-change-the-hostname-of-a-linux-system/

also, run system-config-network and change hostname under DNS tab,
logout then login again

finally, add the new hostname to the hosts file





CHANGE IP
---------


ifconfig add eth0 192.168.63.129

see http://dhika.cikul.or.id/how-to-change-centos-ip-address.html

quote:
ifconfig command create temporary IP address change, if you reboot your server, you will see that your IP still not change. If you want make permanent ip change, you must edit files under /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
unquote.


and edit your /etc/hosts file

cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
vi ifcfg-eth0

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=172.17.17.10
NETMASK=255.255.255.248

<entry [Thu Aug 19 10:57:03 EDT 2010] UNDERSTANDING /etc/fstab>



< How to edit and understand /etc/fstab - 1.1 >

There's a file called /etc/fstab in your Linux system. Learn what its contents mean and how it's used in conjunction with the mount command. When you learn to understand the fstab file, you'll be able to edit its contents yourself, too.
In this tuXfile I assume you already know how to mount filesystems and partitions with the mount command. If you don't, I suggest reading the Mounting tuXfile before reading this one.

< What is fstab and why it's useful >

fstab is a configuration file that contains information of all the partitions and storage devices in your computer. The file is located under /etc, so the full path to this file is /etc/fstab.
/etc/fstab contains information of where your partitions and storage devices should be mounted and how. If you can't access your Windows partition from Linux, aren't able to mount your CD or write to your floppy as a normal user, or have problems with your CD-RW, you probably have a misconfigured /etc/fstab file. So, you can usually fix your mounting problems by editing your fstab file.
/etc/fstab is just a plain text file, so you can open and edit it with any text editor you're familiar with. However, note that you must have the root privileges before editing fstab. So, in order to edit the file, you must either log in as root or use the su command to become root.

< Overview of the file >

Of course everybody has a bit different /etc/fstab file because the partitions, devices and their properties are different on different systems. But the basic structure of fstab is always the same. Here's an example of the contents of /etc/fstab:
/dev/hda2	/	ext2	defaults	1 1
/dev/hdb1	/home	ext2	defaults	1 2
/dev/cdrom	/media/cdrom	auto	ro,noauto,user,exec	0 0
/dev/fd0	/media/floppy	auto	rw,noauto,user,sync	0 0
proc	/proc	proc	defaults	0 0
/dev/hda1	swap	swap	pri=42	0 0
What does all this gibberish mean? As you see, every line (or row) contains the information of one device or partition. The first column contains the device name, the second one its mount point, third its filesystem type, fourth the mount options, fifth (a number) dump options, and sixth (another number) filesystem check options. Let's take a closer look at this stuff.

< 1st and 2nd columns: Device and default mount point >

The first and second columns should be pretty straightforward. They tell the mount command exactly the same things that you tell mount when you mount stuff manually: what is the device or partition, and what is the mount point. The mount point specified for a device in /etc/fstab is its default mount point. That is the directory where the device will be mounted if you don't specify any other mount point when mounting the device.
Like you already learned from the Mounting tuXfile, most Linux distros create special directories for mount points. Most distros create them under /mnt, but some (at least SuSE) under /media. As you probably noticed when looking at the example fstab, I use SuSE's mount points as an example.
What does all this mean? If I type the following command:
$ mount /dev/fd0
... my floppy will be mounted in /media/floppy, because that's the default mount point specified in /etc/fstab. If there is no entry for /dev/fd0 in my fstab when I issue the command above, mount gets very confused because it doesn't know where to mount the floppy.
You can freely change the default mount points listed in /etc/fstab if you're not satisfied with the defaults your distro has given you. Just make sure the mount point is a directory that already exists on your system. If it doesn't, simply create it.
Some partitions and devices are also automatically mounted when your Linux system boots up. For example, have a look at the example fstab above. There are lines that look like this:
/dev/hda2 / ext2 defaults 1 1
/dev/hdb1 /home ext2 defaults 1 2
As you've learned, these lines mean that /dev/hda2 will be mounted to / and /dev/hdb1 to /home. This is done automatically when your Linux system boots up... if it wouldn't, you'd have a hard time using your cool Linux system because all the programs you use are in / and you wouldn't be able to run them if / wasn't mounted! But how does the system know where you want to mount /dev/hda2 and /dev/hdb1? By looking at the /etc/fstab file of course.

< 3rd column: Filesystem type >

The third column in /etc/fstab specifies the filesystem type of the device or partition. Many different filesystems are supported but we'll take a look at the most common ones only.
ext2 and ext3 Very likely your Linux partitions are Ext3. Ext2 used to be the standard filesystem for Linux, but these days, Ext3 and ReiserFS are usually the default filesystems for almost every new Linux distro. Ext3 is a newer filesystem type that differs from Ext2 in that it's journaled, meaning that if you turn the computer off without properly shutting down, you shouldn't lose any data and your system shouldn't spend ages doing filesystem checks the next time you boot up.
reiserfs Your Linux partitions may very well be formatted as ReiserFS. Like Ext3, ReiserFS is a journaled filesystem, but it's much more advanced than Ext3. Many Linux distros (including SuSE) have started using ReiserFS as their default filesystem for Linux partitions.
swap The filesystem name is self-explanatory. The filesystem type "swap" is used in your swap partitions.
vfat and ntfs Your USB stick is most likely formatted as Vfat (more widely known as FAT32). Your Windows partitions are probably either Vfat or NTFS. The 9x series (95, 98, ME) all use Vfat, and the NT series (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7) use NTFS but they may be formatted as Vfat, too.
auto No, this isn't a filesystem type :-) The option "auto" simply means that the filesystem type is detected automatically. If you take a look at the example fstab above, you'll see that the floppy and CD-ROM both have "auto" as their filesystem type. Why? Their filesystem type may vary. One floppy might be formatted for Windows and the other for Linux's Ext2. That's why it's wise to let the system automatically detect the filesystem type of media such as floppies and cdroms.

< 4th column: Mount options >

The fourth column in fstab lists all the mount options for the device or partition. This is also the most confusing column in the fstab file, but knowing what some of the most common options mean, saves you from a big headache. Yes, there are many options available, but I'll take a look at the most widely used ones only. For more information, check out the man page of mount.
auto and noauto With the auto option, the device will be mounted automatically (at bootup, just like I told you a bit earlier, or when you issue the mount -a command). auto is the default option. If you don't want the device to be mounted automatically, use the noauto option in /etc/fstab. With noauto, the device can be mounted only explicitly.
user and nouser These are very useful options. The user option allows normal users to mount the device, whereas nouser lets only the root to mount the device. nouser is the default, which is a major cause of headache for new Linux users. If you're not able to mount your cdrom, floppy, Windows partition, or something else as a normal user, add the user option into /etc/fstab.
exec and noexec exec lets you execute binaries that are on that partition, whereas noexec doesn't let you do that. noexec might be useful for a partition that contains binaries you don't want to execute on your system, or that can't even be executed on your system. This might be the case of a Windows partition.
exec is the default option, which is a good thing. Imagine what would happen if you accidentally used the noexec option with your Linux root partition...
ro Mount the filesystem read-only.
rw Mount the filesystem read-write. Again, using this option might cure the headache of many new Linux users who are tearing their hair off because they can't write to their floppies, Windows partitions, or something else.
sync and async How the input and output to the filesystem should be done. sync means it's done synchronously. If you look at the example fstab, you'll notice that this is the option used with the floppy. In plain English, this means that when you, for example, copy a file to the floppy, the changes are physically written to the floppy at the same time you issue the copy command.
However, if you have the async option in /etc/fstab, input and output is done asynchronously. Now when you copy a file to the floppy, the changes may be physically written to it long time after issuing the command. This isn't bad, and may sometimes be favorable, but can cause some nasty accidents: if you just remove the floppy without unmounting it first, the copied file may not physically exist on the floppy yet!
async is the default. However, it may be wise to use sync with the floppy, especially if you're used to the way it's done in Windows and have a tendency to remove floppies before unmounting them first.
defaults Uses the default options that are rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.

< 5th and 6th columns: Dump and fsck options >

Dump and, uh, what options? Well, dump is a backup utility and fsck is a filesystem check utility. I won't discuss them in great length here (they would both need their own tuXfile), but I'll mention them, because otherwise you'd spend the rest of the day wondering what on God's green Earth do these things mean.
The 5th column in /etc/fstab is the dump option. Dump checks it and uses the number to decide if a filesystem should be backed up. If it's zero, dump will ignore that filesystem. If you take a look at the example fstab, you'll notice that the 5th column is zero in most cases.
The 6th column is a fsck option. fsck looks at the number in the 6th column to determine in which order the filesystems should be checked. If it's zero, fsck won't check the filesystem.

< Example /etc/fstab entries >

As an example, we'll take a look at a couple of fstab entries that have been a source of endless frustration for new Linux users: floppy and CD-ROM (although these days floppies aren't that important anymore).
/dev/fd0 /media/floppy auto rw,noauto,user,sync 0 0
This line means that the floppy is mounted to /media/floppy by default and that its filesystem type is detected automatically. This is useful because the type of the floppy may wary. Note especially the rw and user options: they must be there if you want to be able to mount and write to the floppy as a normal user. If you have trouble with this, check your fstab file to see if these options are there. Also note the sync option. It can be async just as well, but it's sync because of reasons discussed a bit earlier.
/dev/cdrom /media/cdrom auto ro,noauto,user,exec 0 0
Note, again, the user option that enables you to mount the CD as a normal user. The CD-ROM has the ro option because it's no use mounting a CD-ROM read-write because you wouldn't be able to write to it anyway. Also note the exec option. It's especially useful if you'd like to be able to execute something from your CD.
Also note that the noauto option is used with the floppy and CD-ROM. This means that they won't be automatically mounted when your Linux system boots up. This is useful for removable media, because sometimes there won't be any floppy or CD-ROM when you boot up your system, so there isn't any reason to try to mount something that doesn't even exist.

NOTES
-----

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs

xargs is a command on Unix and most Unix-like operating systems. It is useful when one wants to pass a large number of arg
uments to a command. Until Linux kernel 2.6.23, arbitrarily long lists of parameters could not be passed to a command [1], so xargs will break the list of arguments into sublists small enough to be acceptable.

For example, commands like:

rm /path/*

or

rm `find /path -type f`

will fail with an error message of "Argument list too long" if there are too many files in /path.

However this version (functionally equivalent to rm `find /path -type f`) will not fail:

 find /path -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm



#### find . -type f -name _ -exec ls -al '{}' \;


In this example, find feeds the input of xargs with a long list of file names. xargs then splits this list into sublists and calls rm once for every sublist. This is more efficient than this functionally equivalent version:

find /path -type f -exec rm '{}' \;

which calls rm once for every single file. Note however that with modern versions of find, the following variant does the same thing as the xargs version:
 find /path -type f -exec rm '{}' +
xargs often covers the same functionality as the backquote feature of many shells, but is more flexible and often also safer, especially if there are blanks or special characters in the input. It is a good companion for commands that output long lists of files like find, locate and grep, but only if you use -0 as xargs without -0 deals badly with file names containing ', " and space. GNU Parallel is the perfect companion to find, locate and grep if file names may contain ', " and space (newline still requires -0).

<entry [Thu May 13 02:36:22 EDT 2010] SYNCHRONISE DIRECTORIES ON TWO MACHINES>

http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/unix_tips.html


How to 2-way sync local dir and remote machine

Use Unison. Both machines must have unison installed. The rsync tool does just one way sync (overwritting any changes on the remote machine), while unison asks you for each changed file (or non-existant file/dir) which direction you want the update be.

Here's a sample command i use.

Synching to a remote server: unison -servercmd /sw/bin/unison /Users/xah/uci-server/vmm ssh://xahlee@virtualmathmuseum.org//Library/WebServer/Documents/vmm

In this server, it contains works done by other people, so i can't just update it one-way with rsync.

The -servercmd /sw/bin/unison specifies the path of the unison command on the server. (needed when it is not in the default search path on remote machine's user account) The /Users/xah/uci-server/vmm is the local dir. The ssh://xahlee@virtualmathmuseum.org//Library/WebServer/Documents/vmm specifies the remote dir, remote machine's domain name, login account, and the protocol to use.

Synching my PC and Mac: unison -servercmd /usr/bin/unison c:/Users/xah/web ssh://xah@169.254.145.104//Users/xah/web

If you are syncing from Mac and Windows, you many want to add -rsrc false, which will ignore resource fork and file type info. If you want to ignore file permissions, you can use -perms 0

Note that unison is picky about the unison version on your machine and the version on the remote machine. For example, if on your machine you have 2.27, on remote server you have 2.17, then when you try to sync the 2 machines, then unison will complain and stop. (it'll say something to the effect of expected header is 2.27 but got 2.17) Typically, you install more than one version of unison on your machine (or on the remote machine if you can).

Unison has builtin doc. Type unison -help or unison -doc topics.

Note that Unison as of version 2.27, it does not support file names containing Unicode chars. So, if you have files with Chinese chars, math symbols, etc, Unison will still work but the result file name will be gibberish.

<entry [Tue Mar 30 17:42:05 EDT 2010] USING lftp TO AUTOMATE FTP DOWNLOADS>



EXAMPLE

lftp -c "set ftp:list-options -a;
open ftp://user:password@your.ftp.com; 
lcd ./web;
cd /web/public_html;
mirror --reverse --delete --use-cache --verbose --allow-chown  
--allow-suid --no-umask --parallel=2 --exclude-glob .svn"


	
As written by esel

lftp is very good tool.

I suggest you to parametrize the script, and make use of the

exclude-glob
options, that excludes filenames using the glob feature (*,? ..) of your shell:

#!/bin/bash    
HOST="your.ftp.host.dom"
USER="username"
PASS="password"
LCD="/path/of/your/local/dir"
RCD="/path/of/your/remote/dir"
lftp -c "set ftp:list-options -a;
open ftp://$USER:$PASS@$HOST; 
lcd $LCD;
cd $RCD;
mirror --reverse \
       --delete \
       --verbose \
       --exclude-glob a-dir-to-exclude/ \
       --exclude-glob a-file-to-exclude \
       --exclude-glob a-file-group-to-exclude* \
       --exclude-glob other-files-to-esclude"




NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR HOME FOLDER WHEN TESTING!!!! OR YOU MAY DELETE IMPORTANT FILES


E.G., I RAN THIS:

lftp -c "set ftp:list-options -a;
open http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/; 
lcd ./hg19/database;
cd /nethome/syoung/base/pipeline/snpfilter;
mirror --delete --use-cache --verbose --allow-chown  
--allow-suid --no-umask --parallel=2 --exclude-glob .svn"


... AND IT DELETED FILES IN MY ~ DIRECTORY:


> --allow-suid --no-umask --parallel=2 --exclude-glob .svn"
./hg19/database: No such file or directory

            possibly your /nethome/syoung/.kshenv (or whatever is
            specified by the ENV environment variable).
            Also your /nethome/syoung/.bash_profile will be processed.
            The lines are prepended for sourcing the /share/apps/modules/global/csh.modules or
            /share/apps/modules/global/profile.modules files or to define the module alias or function.
            Why is it necessary?
            To insure that you will have access to modules for all subshells,
            these lines need to be added to some of your 'dot' files.
    
            Your old .cshrc, .login, .profile, .bashrc and .kshenv will be
            renamed to .login.old, .cshrc.old, .profile.old, .bashrc.old and

etc...




AVOID THE 'PICKET FENCE'

The character after the s is the delimiter. It is conventionally a slash, because this is what ed, more, and vi use. It can be anything you want, however. If you want to change a pathname that contains a slash - say /usr/local/bin to /common/bin - you could use the backslash to quote the slash:

sed 's/\/usr\/local\/bin/\/common\/bin/' < old >new
Gulp. Some call this a 'Picket Fence' and it's ugly. It is easier to read if you use an underline instead of a slash as a delimiter:

sed 's_/usr/local/bin_/common/bin_' < old >new
Some people use colons:

sed 's:/usr/local/bin:/common/bin:' < old >new
Others use the "|" character.

sed 's|/usr/local/bin|/common/bin|' < old >new




Using & as the matched string

Sometimes you want to search for a pattern and add some characters, like parenthesis, around or near the pattern you found. It is easy to do this if you are looking for a particular string:

sed 's/abc/(abc)/' < old >new
This won't work if you don't know exactly what you will find. How can you put the string you found in the replacement string if you don't know what it is?

The solution requires the special character "&." It corresponds to the pattern found.

sed 's/[a-z]*/(&)/' < old >new
You can have any number of "&" in the replacement string. You could also double a pattern, e.g. the first number of a line:

% echo "123 abc" | sed 's/[0-9]*/& &/'
123 123 abc
Let me slightly amend this example. Sed will match the first string, and make it as greedy as possible. The first match for '[0-9]*' is the first character on the line, as this matches zero of more numbers. So if the input was "abc 123" the output would be unchanged (well, except for a space before the letters). A better way to duplicate the number is to make sure it matches a number:

% echo "123 abc" | sed 's/[0-9][0-9]*/& &/'
123 123 abc
The string "abc" is unchanged, because it was not matched by the regular expression. If you wanted to eliminate "abc" from the output, you must expand the the regular expression to match the rest of the line and explicitly exclude part of the expression using "(", ")" and "\1", which is the next topic.



Using \1 to keep part of the pattern

I have already described the use of "(" ")" and "1" in my tutorial on regular expressions. To review, the escaped parentheses (that is, parentheses with backslashes before them) remember portions of the regular expression. You can use this to exclude part of the regular expression. The "\1" is the first remembered pattern, and the "\2" is the second remembered pattern. Sed has up to nine remembered patterns.

If you wanted to keep the first word of a line, and delete the rest of the line, mark the important part with the parenthesis:

sed 's/\([a-z]*\).*/\1/'
I should elaborate on this. Regular exprssions are greedy, and try to match as much as possible. "[a-z]*" matches zero or more lower case letters, and tries to be as big as possible. The ".*" matches zero or more characters after the first match. Since the first one grabs all of the lower case letters, the second matches anything else. Therefore if you type

echo abcd123 | sed 's/\([a-z]*\).*/\1/'
This will output "abcd" and delete the numbers.

If you want to switch two words around, you can remember two patterns and change the order around:

sed 's/\([a-z]*\) \([a-z]*\)/\2 \1/'
Note the space between the two remembered patterns. This is used to make sure two words are found.

The "\1" doesn't have to be in the replacement string (in the right hand side). It can be in the pattern you are searching for (in the left hand side). If you want to eliminate duplicated words, you can try:

sed 's/\([a-z]*\) \1/\1/'
You can have up to nine values: "\1" thru "\9."



/1, /2, etc. Specifying which occurrence

With no flags, the first pattern is changed. With the "g" option, all patterns are changed. If you want to modify a particular pattern that is not the first one on the line, you could use "\(" and "\)" to mark each pattern, and use "\1" to put the first pattern back unchanged. This next example keeps the first word on the line but deletes the second:

sed 's/\([a-zA-Z]*\) \([a-zA-Z]*\) /\1 /' < old >new
Yuck. There is an easier way to do this. You can add a number after the substitution command to indicate you only want to match that particular pattern. Example:

sed 's/[a-zA-Z]* //2' < old >new
You can combine a number with the g (global) flag. For instance, if you want to leave the first world alone alone, but change the second, third, etc. to DELETED, use /2g:

sed 's/[a-zA-Z]* /DELETED /2g' < old >new
Don't get /2 and \2 confused. The /2 is used at the end. \2 is used in inside the replacement field.

Note the space after the "*" character. Without the space, sed will run a long, long time. (Note: this bug is probably fixed by now.) This is because the number flag and the "g" flag have the same bug. You should also be able to use the pattern

sed 's/[^ ]*//2' < old >new
but this also eats CPU. If this works on your computer, and it does on some Unix systems, you could remove the encrypted password from the password file:

sed 's/[^:]*//2' </etc/passwd >/etc/password.new
But this didn't work for me the time I wrote thise. Using "[^:][^:]*" as a work-around doesn't help because it won't match an non-existent password, and instead delete the third field, which is the user ID! Instead you have to use the ugly parenthesis:

sed 's/^\([^:]*\):[^:]:/\1::/' </etc/passwd >/etc/password.new
You could also add a character to the first pattern so that it no longer matches the null pattern:

sed 's/[^:]*:/:/2' </etc/passwd >/etc/password.new
The number flag is not restricted to a single digit. It can be any number from 1 to 512. If you wanted to add a colon after the 80th character in each line, you could type:

sed 's/./&:/80' <file >new
You can also do it the hard way by using 80 dots:

sed 's/^................................................................................/&:/' <file >new

    Illumina to sanger conversion - ID: 2824334
    Last Update: Attachment added ( daweonline )
    Details:
    
    As new Illumina software (GA 1.3+) has changed quality score encoding, I've
    written a small patch which adds 'ill2sanger' function, to convert new
    illumina fastq files into sanger fastq.
    It applies to maq-0.7.1. Essentially it takes the illumina score and adds
    2. The function to read fastq files (defined in seq.c) removes 33 to this
    score, so that the overall operation is removal of 31 from illumina score

NOTES
=====



http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/how-do-you-apply-a-diff-patch-529154/
The basic concept it to apply the 'diff' using the patch command.
Basic command syntax
Code:
$ patch -p[num] < [patchfile]
Example
Code:
$ patch -p1 < diff
Whether or not this will work for your diff file will depend on what your patching and how the diff file is written. Recommend doing 'man patch' and 'man diff' and read the manual. Would also help you to look at any README files or HOW-To's about the specific use of the diff you trying to apply.

   Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and
       delete them.  Note that this will  work  incorrectly  if
       there  are  any filenames containing newlines, single or
       double quotes, or spaces.

       find /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0  /bin/rm
       -f

       Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and
       delete them, processing filenames in  such  a  way  that
       file  or  directory  names  containing  single or double
       quotes, spaces or newlines are correctly  handled.   The
       -name test comes before the -type test in order to avoid
       having to call stat(2) on every file.

       find . -type f -exec file â{}â \;

       Runs âfileâ on every file in or below the current direc-
       tory.   Notice  that  the  braces are enclosed in single
       quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell
       script  punctuation.    The  semicolon is similarly pro-
       tected by the use of a backslash, though â;â could  have
       been used in that case also.

       find /    \( -perm -4000 -fprintf /root/suid.txt â%#m %u %p\nâ \) , \

       Traverse  the filesystem just once, listing setuid files
       and directories into /root/suid.txt and large files into
       /root/big.txt.

       find $HOME -mtime 0

       Search  for files in your home directory which have been
       modified in the last twenty-four  hours.   This  command
       works this way because the time since each file was last
       modified is divided by 24 hours  and  any  remainder  is

<entry [Mon Oct 27 14:29:39 EDT 2008] USE diff TO APPLY A PATCH>





Creating and Applying Patches
http://www.whatwoulddrupaldo.org/creating-and-applying-patches

I regularly find myself digging up the proper nodes to explain to someone on the forums how to apply a patch either from a shell command line or locally on a windows machine.

I also find myself always needing to dig up the information on the proper command line syntax for generating a patch for submission.

So here's the scoop, so I don't have to do all that oh-so-complicated searching everytime ;)

Creating a patch:

diff -uF^function old.module new.module > file.patch

More info available at http://drupal.org/diffanpatch

Applying a patch from shell:

patch old.module < file.patch



(I find that the -p option is rarely needed)

<entry [Wed Oct 22 23:47:10 EDT 2008] RPM HOW TO UNINSTALL>



http://www.faqs.org/docs/securing/chap4sec23.html

Use RPM command to uninstall.

The command to uninstall software is:

$ rpm -e <softwarename(s)>
         

Where <softwarename> is the name of the software you want to uninstall e.g. (foo).

Since Programs like apmd, kudzu, and sendmail are daemons that run as process. It is better to stop those processes before uninstalling them from the system.To stop those processes, use the following commands:

         [root@deep] /# /etc/rc.d/init.d/apmd stop
         [root@deep] /# /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail stop
         [root@deep] /# /etc/rc.d/init.d/kudzu stop
         

   1.

      Version 6.1 only Now you can uninstall them safely, and all other packages, as shown below: Remove the specified packages for Red Hat Linux version 6.1 (Cartman).

                   [root@deep] /# rpm -e --nodeps pump mt-st eject mailcap apmd kernel-pcmcia-cs linuxconf getty_ps 
                   setconsole isapnptools setserial kudzu raidtools gnupg redhat-logos redhat-release gd pciutils rmt

      Version 6.2. only Remove the specified packages for Red Hat Linux version 6.2 (Zoot).

                   [root@deep] /# rpm -e --nodeps pump mt-st eject mailcap apmd kernel-pcmcia-cs linuxconf getty_ps 
                   isapnptools setserial kudzu raidtools gnupg redhat-logos redhat-release gd pciutils rmt

   2.

      Version All Remove the linux.conf-installed file manually.

               [root@deep] /# rm -f /etc/conf.linuxconf-installed
               

    Note: This is a configuration file related to linuxconf software that must be removed manually. 

The program hdparm is needed by IDE hard disk but not SCSI hard disks. If you have an IDE disk on your system you must keep this program (hdparm), but if you don't have an IDE hard disk you can remove it safely from your system. To remove hdparm from your system, use the following command:

         [root@deep] /# rpm -e hdparm
         

Use the programs kbdconfig, mouseconfig, timeconfig, authconfig, ntsysv, and setuptool in order to set your keyboard language and type, your mouse type, your default time zone, your NIS and shadow passwords, your numerous symbolic links in /etc/rc.d directory, and text mode menu utility which allow you to access all of these features. After those configurations have been set during the installation stage of your Linux server it's rare that you would need to change them again. So, you can uninstall them, and if in future you need to change your keyboard, mouse, default time, etc again via test mode menu, all you have to do is to install the program with the RPM from your original CD-ROM. To remove all the above programs from your system, use the following command:

         [root@deep] /# rpm -e kbdconfig mouseconfig timeconfig authconfig ntsysv setuptool
         

Even if you are not intending to install a mail server on your Linux system, the program Sendmail is always needed on your servers for potential messages sent to the root user by different software services installed on your machine.

Sendmail is a Mail Transport Agent -MTA program that sends mail from one machine to another. It can be configured in different manners; it can serve as an internal delivery mail system to a Mail Hub Server, or can be configured to be a Central Mail Hub Server for all Sendmail machines on your network. So depending on what you want to do with Sendmail, you must configure it to respond to your specific needs. For this reason you must uninstall Sendmail and see the relevant sections in this book that is related to Sendmail configuration and installation.

To remove Sendmail from your system, use the following command:

         [root@deep] /# rpm -e sendmail

<entry [Wed Oct 22 23:03:08 EDT 2008] HOW TO USE Apt AND yum>



BASED ON THIS PAGE:

http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/FAQ.php#B4

B3. How do I use Apt ?
Apt originally was developed by the Debian project to work together with DEB packages. Since there are not many functional differences between RPM and DEB packages, Conectiva ported Apt to use RPM.

To install Apt, download the latest package for your distribution from: http://dag.wieers.com/packages/apt/. The configuration of Apt is inside the rpmforge-release package.

If you've done that, the rest is simple. Update the local repository meta-data by doing:

apt-get update
You can upgrade your system with the latest packages with:

apt-get upgrade
And finally you can add new software by typing:

apt-get install <name of package>
Or search for software in the local repository meta-data:

apt-cache search <keyword> apt-cache show <name of package>
From time to time you may want to save some diskspace:

apt-get clean
Remember to update your local repository often before upgrading or installing software, so that you can enjoy the latest and greatest.

Some people rather use a graphical program to select and install packages. Apt has a nifty graphical front-end, called Synaptic. You can install it by doing:

apt-get install synaptic
Or download it from: http://dag.wieers.com/packages/synaptic/

B4. How do I use Yum ?
Yum is an update-tool written in python. The advantage of Yum is that it is written in Python. The disadvantage is that there are many versions of Yum, and only recent versions work with recent distributions. If you like to use a single tool across all distributions, it's better to use Apt.

Yum is usually already installed if you're running Fedora Core. In case you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux or an older Red Hat Linux distribution. You can find Yum at: http://dag.wieers.com/packages/yum/

The configuration of Yum is inside the rpmforge-release package. You need to install it yourself.

If you've done that, the rest is simple. Upgrade your system by doing:

yum update
You can add new software by typing:

yum install <name of package>
Or update installed software:

yum update <name of package>
Or search for software in the local repository meta-data:

yum search <keyword>
Or simply list all available software:

yum list available
From time to time you may want to save some diskspace:

yum clean

ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS ARE BASED ON:

Howto: Linux Add User To Group
http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-linux-add-user-to-group/#comment-37267


useradd example - Add a new user to secondary group
===================================================

Use useradd command to add new users to existing group (or create a new group and then add user). If group does not exist, create it. Syntax:

    useradd -G {group-name} username

Create a new user called vivek and add it to group called developers. First login as a root user (make sure group developers exists), enter:

    grep developers /etc/group

developers:x:1124:


If you do not see any output then you need to add group developers using groupadd command:

    groupadd developers

Next, add a user called vivek to group developers:

    useradd -G developers vivek

Setup password for user vivek:

    passwd vivek

Ensure that user added properly to group developers:

    id vivekOutput:

uid=1122(vivek) gid=1125(vivek) groups=1125(vivek),1124(developers)

Please note that capital G (-G) option add user to a list of supplementary groups. Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace. For example, add user jerry to groups admins, ftp, www, and developers, enter:

    useradd -G admins,ftp,www,developers jerry



useradd example - Add a new user to primary group
=================================================

To add a user tony to group developers use following command:

    useradd -g developers tony
    id tony

    uid=1123(tony) gid=1124(developers) groups=1124(developers)


Please note that small -g option add user to initial login group (primary group). The group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group.



usermod example - Add a existing user to existing group
=======================================================

Add existing user tony to ftp supplementary/secondary group with usermod command using -a option ~ i.e. add the user to the supplemental group(s). Use only with -G option :


    usermod -a -G ftp tony
    
Change existing user tony primary group to www:

    usermod -g www tony

greppy -l  SESSION.get(idEntreprise) | xargs sed -i -e s/SESSION.get(idEntreprise)/SESSION.get(\idEntreprise\)/

One handy alias :
alias greppy=find . -name "*.py" | grep -v svn | xargs grep color



perl with grep and xargs
========================



grep -rl OLDSTRING *.FILEEXTENSION | xargs perl -pi~ -e 's/OLDSTRING/NEWSTRING/g'



sed (stream editor)
===================

We have a file called sedtest.txt, which contains the string "1.0". To
change the string to "2.0":

sed -e 's/1.0/2.0/g' sedtest.txt > sedtest2.txt mv f sedtest2.txt sedtest.txt

Remove empty lines:

sed -e '/^ *$/d' sedtest1.txt 


perl
====

perl -p -i -e s/text/replacement text/g" filename


shell script
============

cd pathname
for y in `ls *`;
do 
   sed 's_c:/mydocuments/pictures_d:/mypics/personal_' $y > temp; mv temp $y;
done

1. CREATE THE phpinfo.php FILE IN THE HTML DIRECTORY:

<?php
#Wallpaperama.com
phpinfo();
?>


2. BROWSE TO IT AND LOOK FOR THE Configuration File (php.ini) Path 

/etc/php.ini


3. CHECK THE CURRENT VALUE OF post_max_size

post_max_size	8M	8M


4. EDIT post_max_size IN THE php.ini FILE

; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.
post_max_size = 100M


5. RESTART APACHE

/usr/sbin/apachectl -k stop   
/usr/sbin/apachectl -k start

NB: START AND STOP IS BETTER THAN RESTART

/usr/sbin/apachectl -k restart

Ubuntu Linux Restore admin / root level permissions

http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/ubuntu-admin-group-permissions.html

Posted by Vivek Gite [Last updated: November 1, 2007]

I was writing and testing few python scripts (yes I'm moving lot of stuff from shell / perl to python these days) and accidentally I renamed my own user account from vivek to test. However, I did not noticed change until I rebooted my box. Now I cannot run sudo (or become a root user) and cannot access special devices such as sound or video.

By default your first account has all power via sudo under Ubuntu Linux. There is a special group called adm and admin which grants unlimited power via sudo.

The only solution was to boot computer in emergency mode (reboot computer and at grub menu select recovery mode kernel), open /etc/group file and add user vivek to admin and adm group:
# vi /etc/group
Add user vivek to admin and adm group:
admin:x:117:vivek
adm:x:4:vivek

Save and close the file.

Now I'm able to run sudo and do other stuff. Luckily, my scripts always backup critical files before modification. So I was able to restore permission instantly. Here is my group membership with all power and glory ;)
$ id
$ groups
Output:

vivek adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev scanner netdev lpad

ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS ARE BASED ON:

Howto: Linux Add User To Group
http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-linux-add-user-to-group/#comment-37267


useradd example - Add a new user to secondary group
===================================================

Use useradd command to add new users to existing group (or create a new group and then add user). If group does not exist, create it. Syntax:

    useradd -G {group-name} username

Create a new user called vivek and add it to group called developers. First login as a root user (make sure group developers exists), enter:

    grep developers /etc/group

developers:x:1124:


If you do not see any output then you need to add group developers using groupadd command:

    groupadd developers

Next, add a user called vivek to group developers:

    useradd -G developers vivek

Setup password for user vivek:

    passwd vivek

Ensure that user added properly to group developers:

    id vivekOutput:

uid=1122(vivek) gid=1125(vivek) groups=1125(vivek),1124(developers)

Please note that capital G (-G) option add user to a list of supplementary groups. Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace. For example, add user jerry to groups admins, ftp, www, and developers, enter:

    useradd -G admins,ftp,www,developers jerry



useradd example - Add a new user to primary group
=================================================

To add a user tony to group developers use following command:

    useradd -g developers tony
    id tony

    uid=1123(tony) gid=1124(developers) groups=1124(developers)


Please note that small -g option add user to initial login group (primary group). The group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group.



usermod example - Add a existing user to existing group
=======================================================

Add existing user tony to ftp supplementary/secondary group with usermod command using -a option ~ i.e. add the user to the supplemental group(s). Use only with -G option :


    usermod -a -G ftp tony
    
Change existing user tony primary group to www:

    usermod -g www tony

<entry [Fri Aug 29 16:35:55 EDT 2008] RESTART SSHD SERVER + Disabling root login via SSH (CentOS)>




1. RESTART SSHD SERVER

    sudo /etc/init.d/sshd restart

2. Disabling root login via SSH (CentOS)

This specifically applies to Centos 5.x

    # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Preferably do this on a second login if you have to do this on a remote system and keep the one of them open! All you have to do is locate the line PermitRootLogin yes and change it to:

    PermitRootLogin no

Then restart SSH:

    # /etc/init.d/sshd restart

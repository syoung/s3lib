Executive Summary

ValuedMe offers free services and premium value-added services for individuals who have their DNA sequence or genetic markers. All services will be provided through the ValuedMe website and mobile application. There are three free services: 1) a genetic health profile alerting the individual to potential disease risks, 2) optional inclusion in cohorts of individuals with similar disease risk profiles, and 3) a breakdown of the customer's ancestry. Cohorts are challenged to take steps to reduce their specific risk (e.g., heart disease, asthma, diabetes) and to share information about the efficacy of drug and non-drug treatment regimens. A game-based approach and peer encouragement will improve the customer's chances of successfully maintaining good habits to reduce their risk within their cohort. There are two premium subscription services: 1) an advanced genetic analysis based on genetic data and health information from family members with detailed strategies for reducing health risks and potential treatments, and 2) a genetic matchmaking service between members aimed at maximizing emotional compatibility and minimizing potential health risks to possible offspring.

Keys to Success

There are three keys to success: 1) the website and mobile application must immediately capture the customer's attention and ultimately win their loyalty, 2) the predictions must be based on the most up-to-date scientific research, and 3) ValuedMe must develop a research engine that integrates genetic data with health, personality and behavioral data to discover new genetic factors and deliver this to customers effectively. The website and mobile application will be designed to facilitate easy input of the customer's cohort-related activities and integrate with popular social networking tools. They will also be used to invite customers to participate in surveys on different aspects of their health, well-being and personality. All participants will receive a detailed report of the results of each survey.

List no more than 3 positions, projects or organizations where you have been able to demonstrate your leadership (include year of achievement)

2008-2009 
When I began my postdoc at the University of Miami. I was given the sole responsibility of setting up the university's NextGen analysis pipelines and data management infrastructure. At that time, NextGen pipelines were uncharted territory and there were concerns about data integrity, data storage and analysis best practices. It was imperative to set up a high quality pipeline (scalable, robust and maintainable) in as short at time as possible. I worked independently to assess the technical challenges while also collaborating with a wide range of stakeholders inside the university to determine the system requirements. I also cooperated with external bioinformatics experts to share experiences of different NextGen analysis tools. Within three months I had produced the first version - a fully functional bioinformatics pipeline. The pipeline was used to conduct pioneering high-throughput NextGen bioinformatics analyses for the Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, Center for the Cure for Paralysis, Department of Cardiology and other groups in the University of Miami.

1995-1996 
I led a team of four local government functionaries and a dozen volunteers to prepare for the Nagano Winter Olympics in Japan. I helped build relationships between the city council and foreigners living in the area around the city of Shiojiri. Created and produced 'Shiojiri Global', Japan's first trilingual community magazine (English, Portuguese and Chinese). The magazine featured information for foreigners about local city council services, legal help, free language courses, cultural tips, etc. I also set up the city's first free Japanese language courses for foreigners and promoted outreach to the large Brazilian community, helping them expand their cultural activities. I founded traditions that continue to this day in the city, including the annual Burns Night celebration (haggis, whisky and Scottish country dancing).


Why do you wish to join the Startup Leadership Program? (maximum of 100 words) 


This my first startup and I can't think of a better way than to do it in the company of others who are going through the same challenging, painful and exciting process. I like the collegial aspect too - I enjoy contributing to other people's success, particularly if they are trying to help themselves and others. I am sure I will also benefit enormously from the advice of Fellows and Mentors who have probably experienced a lot of the pitfalls I will encounter along the way. The structured approach will also help me fill in my weaknesses and blind spots. 


Describe an example where you were involved in building the entrepreneurial community. You may include information about your networks to other startups, investors, and experts. (maximum of 100 words)

(or)

Have you had an impact or made a difference to any individual or group? If yes, please describe how and when.(maximum of 100 words) 

I struck up a conversation with a customer in a bookstore who it turned out had a rare inherited disease and was suffering from steadily worsening mental health due to periodic strokes. I offered to analyze his DNA for free to see if there were ways to improve his condition. I was surprised by the hope I gave him, not just for himself but for his son. I am currently working with his extended family to educate them about the current possibilities and limitations of personal genomics. I am empowering them to create strategies for maximizing their health and well-being.


Tell us something interesting, memorable, quirky or unique about yourself (e.g. traveled to the North Pole, guitarist in a band, like to collect wines, coach my son's robotics team)

I am learning the cello to keep up with my kids. I also speak seven languages, including Chinese and Japanese.

ValuedMe

Executive Summary

ValuedMe offers free services and premium value-added services for individuals who have their DNA sequence or genetic markers. All services will be provided through the ValuedMe website and mobile application. There are three free services: 1) a genetic health profile alerting the individual to potential disease risks, 2) optional inclusion in cohorts of individuals with similar disease risk profiles, and 3) a breakdown of the customer's ancestry.

The Market

Falling costs and greater consumer awareness of DNA sequencing is leading to an upcoming explosion in personal genomics data which will rapidly expand the market for genetic analysis. ValuedMe will target two customer segments of the growing personal genomics market: 20-35 year olds and 36-60 year olds. ValuedMe's services must appear fun and personalized in order to be popular with the younger age group and also appear trustworthy and relevant for the older age group. Targeting two distinct large groups with the same technology platform allows ValuedMe to achieve economies of scale earlier and capitalize sooner on the growth opportunities in the market.

Objectives

Become the premier provider of genetic health counseling and matchmaking services in the USA. Provide free and premium products that meet and anticipate our customers' needs. Improve the accuracy of our personal health risk, ancestry analysis, matchmaking and offspring health risk predictions by computational methods and by leveraging the detailed health information collected over time. Ensure sustainable profits through developing subscription-based premium products. Increase loyalty by strengthening user identification with their cohort community.

Keys to Success

There are three keys to success: 1) the website and mobile application must immediately capture the customer's attention and ultimately win their loyalty, 2) the predictions must be based on the most up-to-date scientific research, and 3) ValuedMe must develop a research engine that integrates genetic data with health, personality and behavioral data to discover new genetic factors and deliver this to customers effectively.

The Value of Personal Genomic Analysis
What Will You Get Out of Analyzing Your Own DNA?

Interpreting DNA Analysis Results

To address the interpretation challenge for individuals, third-party resources have also appeared. For example Promethease, based on the SNPmedia database created by geneticist Greg Lennon and programmer Mike Cariaso, and openSNP, an open source resource created by several graduate students for sharing and interpreting genotyping information provide ready resources for individuals that want help analyzing their genomic information.

Meanwhile geneticists have developed Mutadatabase to provide a centralized database documenting all the research findings related to genomic DNA variations to help ensure the availability of the most up-to-date information for interpretation.

You Have Your Ancestor’s DNA

In addition to the health-related predispositions, individual genetic data also provides information about where your ancestry originated. As humans evolved and moved around the globe, small DNA mutations, many of which had no effect, occurred in different scattered individuals. These variations were then passed to progeny and accumulated in geographically separated populations. In 2005, National Geographic launched a massive project to catalog these mutations and use this information track historic human migration patterns.

Genetic analysis enables individuals to map the historic populations that contributed to their genome. According to surveys of 23andMe customers presented at the 2012 American Society of Human Genetics, about 70% of people have genome analysis done because they are interested in these results. Ancestry.com and FamilyTreeDNA have recognized this market segment.

The Coded DNA Oracle

It shouldn't be surprising that people are very interested for find out what's in their genes. If popular interest in psychic predictions and credence in astrology, numerology, palm reading, and related pseudoscience disciplines is any indication, most of us have a strong desire to understand more about who we are and what might be in store for us. Why wouldn't there be similar interest in personal genomics? The type of information you get is not so different than a psychic reading. Genetic analysis, though, is based on results from actual scientific studies so, even if the information is only slightly more informative than a tarot card reading today, future research will likely produce continued incremental improvement of the predictive value.

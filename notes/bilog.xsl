Tech N9ne
Omg, I have arrived in the future
Pussy2bomb
Dirty dancing
In the spotlight
Tits out for the boyz
It takes a nation of white trash

Hey babe. I don't expect you to reply. I just need to let you know I'm still here for you and longing for the day when we'll be together again.

It's been eight days since I last held you baby. They say the first lash is the worst... but I'm missing you harder every day. Two nights ago I stalked you on Youtube just to hear your voice and see your face. An interview with an Anarchist site and you were stellar. I fell asleep with my headphones on blissful and at ease.

My roomate is a nice kid and a filthy, dirty beast. The room reeks of cigarette smoke. It burns my eyes as soon as I enter. I slept in my car last night it was so bad. Maybe it'll get better after cleaning...

In any case, it wasn't nearly as bad as the weed meetup kid. I went to a weed exchange in D.C. on Tuesday hoping to meet some growers/activists/etc. Three cats, vomit/mess on filthy bed + stoned iguana + every room a bombed-out shell full of trash. Why did I inhale from the bong? Is bronchitis contagious... Do I want to hurt myself to dull the pain of your absence? I'm going straight, no drugs just pain. And I guess my writing this is my anaesthetic, as far as that goes. I love you babe. Wow, hurts like hell. But I'd rather anything than lose you babe.

I-L-F-Y

  <p class="regulartext">NIH has received new funds for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2009 and
    2010 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery
    Act). NIH has designated at least $<span class="regulartext"><span>200</span></span> million for a new initiative called the <b>NIH Challenge Grants in Health and
    Science Research </b>(see<b> </b><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/challenge_award/">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/challenge_award/</a>).
    This new program will support research on topic areas which address specific
    scientific and health research challenges in biomedical and behavioral research
    that would benefit from significant 2-year jumpstart funds. NIH Institute and
    Centers have selected specific Challenge Topics within each of the Challenge
    Areas. The research in these Challenge Areas should have a high impact in
    biomedical or behavioral science and/or public health.</p>
  <ul><li><span class="regulartextChar1"><b>Purpose</b></span><b>.</b><span class="regulartext">
As part of the Recovery Act, the NIH invites, through this limited
competition, NIH Challenge Grant (RC1) applications from domestic
(United States) institutions/organizations proposing novel research in
areas that address specific knowledge gaps, scientific opportunities,
new technologies, data</span> generation, or
      research methods that would benefit from an influx of funds to quickly advance
      the area in significant ways.  This program is designed to support research in scientific
      areas identified by the Institutes and Centers, as described below. </li>
    <li><span class="regulartextChar1"><b>Mechanism of Support. </b></span>This FOA will utilize the NIH Challenge
      Grant (RC1) <span class="regulartextChar1">award
        mechanism.  </span></li>
    <li><span class="regulartext"><b><span>Funds
      Available and Anticipated Number of Awards. </span></b></span>
This initiative is funded under the Recovery Act. NIH has designated at
least $200 million in FYs 2009 - 2010 to fund 200 or more grants,
contingent upon the submission of a sufficient number of scientifically
meritorious applications. In addition, Recovery Act funds allocated to
NIH specifically for comparative effectiveness research (CER) may be
available to support additional grants. Projects receiving these funds
will need to meet this definition of CER: “a rigorous evaluation of the
impact of different options that are available for treating a given
medical condition for a particular set of patients. Such a study may
compare similar treatments, such as competing drugs, or it may analyze
very different approaches, such as surgery and drug therapy.” Such
research may include the development and use of clinical registries,
clinical data networks, and other forms of electronic health data that
can be used to generate or obtain outcomes data as they apply to CER.<br>
    </li>
    <li><span class="regulartextChar1"><b>Budget and Project Period.</b></span> Budget requests should be commensurate with project needs up to a two-year
      project period. The requested budget may not exceed $500,000 total costs per
      year for a maximum of $1,000,000 total costs over a two-year project period.

    Research Objectives</span> <br>
    <br>
    <span class="regulartext">The mission of NIH is science in pursuit of fundamental
    knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of
    that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.
    To that end, the NIH, through the extramural grants programs of its Institutes
    and Centers, supports a broad range of biomedical research. </span><span class="regulartext"><span>Previous research has enormously
    increased our understanding of the molecular, cellular and behavioral bases of
    disease and our approaches to health care. At the same time, these advances
    have identified new gaps in our knowledge and have created needs for new
    technologies.  This FOA is designed to provide
    investigators with the opportunity to address these unique challenges by
    addressing new avenues of research in defined areas</span></span> where progress
    would produce a significant impact on biomedical or behavioral science and/or
    health research.</p>
  <p class="regulartext"><span class="regulartext"><span>Applicants to the Challenge Grants
    Program must specify both the broad Challenge Area and the </span></span>specific Challenge
    Topic<span class="regulartext"><span>
that their research addresses. Applicants must also clearly articulate
how the proposed studies would significantly extend our understanding
of biomedical or behavioral science and/or health as it relates to the
specific </span></span><span class="regulartext"><span>Challenge T</span></span><span class="regulartext"><span>opic selected. </span></span><span class="regulartext"><span>  </span></span></p>

  Funds Available </span></p>
  <p class="regulartext">
This initiative is funded under the Recovery Act. NIH has designated at
least $200 million in FYs 2009 - 2010 to fund 200 or more grants,
contingent upon the submission of a sufficient number of scientifically
meritorious applications. In addition, Recovery Act funds allocated to
NIH specifically for comparative effectiveness research (CER) may be
available to support additional grants. Projects receiving these funds
will need to meet this definition of CER: “a rigorous evaluation of the
impact of different options that are available for treating a given
medical condition for a particular set of patients. Such a study may
compare similar treatments, such as competing drugs, or it may analyze
very different approaches, such as surgery and drug therapy.” Such
research may include the development and use of clinical registries,
clinical data networks, and other forms of electronic health data that
can be used to generate or obtain outcomes data as they apply to CER.</p>
  <p class="regulartext">Budget
    proposals are limited to $500,000 total costs per year for a total of
  $1,000,000 total costs over two years. </p>
  <p class="regulartext">Because
    the nature and scope of the proposed research will vary, it is anticipated that
    the size of each award will vary. However, the duration of the awards issued
    under this FOA will be limited to two years.</p>

  <p class="regulartextChar"><span class="regulartext">The
    decision of whether to apply for a grant with a single PD/PI or multiple
    PDs/PIs grant is the responsibility of the investigators and applicant
    organizations and should be determined by the scientific goals of the project.
    Applications for grants with multiple PDs/PIs will require additional
    information, as outlined in the instructions below. The NIH review criteria for
    approach, investigators, and environment have been modified to accommodate
    applications involving either a single PD/PI or multiple PDs/PIs. When
    considering the multiple PD/PI option, please be aware that the structure and
    governance of the PD/PI leadership team as well as the knowledge, skills and
    experience of the individual PDs/PIs will be factored into the assessment of
    the overall scientific merit of the application.  Multiple PDs/PIs on a project
    share the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the project,
    intellectually and logistically. Each PD/PI is responsible and accountable
    to the grantee organization, or, as appropriate, to a collaborating
    organization, for the proper conduct of the project or program, including the
    submission of required reports. For further information on multiple PDs/PIs,

    expected to set forth sex/gender-based hypotheses and plans for data analysis based
    on a consideration of the relevant literature if the proposed study has the
    potential for such consideration. The purpose of this approach is three-fold:
    to ensure compliance with the NIH Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and
    Minorities in Clinical Research; to capitalize on the growing body of research
    demonstrating sex/gender differences in all areas of NIH research from basic to
    clinical and translational; and to ensure that any sex/gender-specific
    solutions/answers to the stubborn questions are not overlooked, thus resulting
    in incorrect conclusions/generalizations with respect to men or women.  If
    these sex/gender-based hypotheses are not relevant to the proposed research,
    applicants should provide scientific justification for why sex/gender
    analysis would not be relevant.</p>
  <p class="regulartext">Applicants for Challenge Grants are expected to address the
    inclusion of members of minority groups and their subpopulations in developing
    a research design appropriate to the scientific objectives of the study and set
    forth racial/ethnic-based hypotheses and plans for data analyses based on a
    consideration of the relevant literature.</p>
  <p class="regulartext">The purpose of this approach is to: 1) ensure compliance with the
    NIH Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research; 2)
    address gaps in what is known about health disparities between racial/ethnic
    groups; and 3) ensure that any potential answers to stubborn questions are not
    overlooked, thus resulting in incorrect conclusions and/or generalizations.  If
    the inclusion of members of minority groups and their subpopulations is not
    relevant to the proposed research, applicants should provide scientific
    justification for why racial/ethnic analyses would not be relevant.</p>
  <p class="regulartext">Applicants
    for Challenge Grants that include children are expected, consistent with the "<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-024.html">NIH Policy and
    Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in Research Involving Human
    Subjects</a>," to set forth age-appropriate hypotheses and plans for data analyses based on a
    consideration of the relevant literature. This approach is designed: 1) to promote
    better compliance with the NIH Pediatric Inclusion policy; 2) to address wide gaps
    in what is known about clinically significant differences, between children and
    adults and among children of different ages and developmental stages, in the
    diagnosis and treatment of diseases and conditions; and 3) to ensure that any
    potential answers to stubborn questions in pediatrics, as well as in early
    origins of adult disease, are not overlooked.  If age-appropriate
    hypotheses are not relevant to the proposed research, applicants should provide
    a specific, scientific justification for why age-appropriate analyses would not
    be relevant. </p>

    sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration
    of the following five core review criteria, and additional review criteria (as
    applicable for the project proposed).  </p>
  <p class="regulartext"><b>Core Review Criteria.  </b>Reviewers will consider each of the five review criteria
    below in the determination of scientific and technical merit, and give a
    separate score for each.  An application does not need to be strong in all
    categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact.  For
    example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to
    advance a field.</p>
  <p class="regulartext"><b><i>Significance.</i></b>  Does the project address an important problem or a
    critical barrier to progress in the field?  If the aims of the project are
    achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technological advances, technical
    capability, clinical practice, and/or health be improved?  How will
    successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies,
    treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?<span class="regulartext"><span> </span></span></p>
  <p class="regulartext"><b><i>Investigator(s).</i></b>  Are the PD/PIs, collaborators, and other researchers
    well suited to the project?  If Early Stage Investigators or New
    Investigators, do they have appropriate experience and training?  If
    established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that
    have advanced their field(s)?  If the project is collaborative or
    multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise;
    are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure
    appropriate for the project? </p>
  <p class="regulartext"><b><i>Innovation. </i></b> Does the application challenge and seek
    to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel
    theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or
    interventions?  Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies,
    instrumentation, technological developments, or interventions novel to one
    field of research or novel in a broad sense?  Is a refinement,

    development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly
    risky aspects be managed? <br>
    If the project involves clinical research, are the plans for 1) protection of
    human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion of minorities and members
    of both sexes/genders, as well as the inclusion of children, justified in terms
    of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?<span class="regulartext"><span> </span></span></p>

  <p class="regulartext"><span class="regulartextChar1"><b>Policy
    for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):</b></span><br>
    <span class="regulartext">NIH is interested
    in advancing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify common genetic
    factors that influence health and disease through a centralized GWAS data
    repository. For the purposes of this policy, a genome-wide association study is
    defined as any study of genetic variation across the entire human genome that
    is designed to identify genetic associations with observable traits (such as
    blood pressure or weight), or the presence or absence of a disease or
    condition. All applications, regardless of the amount requested, proposing a
    genome-wide association study are expected to provide a plan for submission of
    GWAS data to the NIH-designated GWAS data repository, or provide an appropriate
    explanation why submission to the repository is not possible. Data repository
    management (submission and access) is governed by the Policy for Sharing of
    Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies, </span><a href="http://www.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-07-088.html"><span class="regulartext">NIH Guide </span>NOT-OD-07-088</a><span class="regulartext">.

  <p class="regulartext"><span class="regulartext"><b>Sharing of Model Organisms:</b></span> <br>
    <span class="regulartext">NIH
    is committed to support efforts that encourage sharing of important research
    resources including the sharing of model organisms for biomedical research (see </span><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/model_organism/index.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/model_organism/index.htm</a><span class="regulartext">).
    At the same time the NIH recognizes the rights of grantees and contractors to
    elect and retain title to subject inventions developed with Federal funding
    pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act (see the </span><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/NIHGPS_Part7.htm#_Toc54600131"><i>NIH Grants Policy Statement</i></a><span class="regulartext">.
    Beginning October 1, 2004, all investigators submitting an NIH application or
    contract proposal are expected to include in the application/proposal a
    description of a specific plan for sharing and distributing unique model
    organism research resources generated using NIH funding or state why such
    sharing is restricted or not possible. This will permit other researchers to
    benefit from the resources developed with public funding. The inclusion of a
    model organism sharing plan is not subject to a cost threshold in any year and
    is expected to be included in all applications where the development of model
    organisms is anticipated. </span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="regulartext"><b>Access
    to Research Data through the Freedom of Information Act:</b></span> <br>
    <span class="regulartext">The
    Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 has been revised to
    provide access to research data through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
    under some circumstances. Data that are: (1) first produced in a project that
    is supported in whole or in part with Federal funds; and (2) cited publicly and
    officially by a Federal agency in support of an action that has the force and
    effect of law (i.e., a regulation) may be accessed through FOIA. It is
    important for applicants to understand the basic scope of this amendment. NIH
    has provided guidance at </span><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/a110/a110_guidance_dec1999.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/a110/a110_guidance_dec1999.htm</a><span class="regulartext">.
    Applicants may wish to place data collected under this funding opportunity in a
    public archive, which can provide protections for the data and manage the
    distribution for an indefinite period of time. If so, the application should
    include a description of the archiving plan in the study design and include
    information about this in the budget justification section of the application.
    In addition, applicants should think about how to structure informed consent
    statements and other human subjects procedures given the potential for wider
    use of data collected under this award.</span> </p>
  <p class="regulartext"><span class="regulartext"><b>Inclusion of Women And Minorities in
    Clinical Research:</b></span> <br>
    <span class="regulartext">It is
    the policy of the NIH that women and members of minority groups and their
    sub-populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research
    projects unless a clear and compelling justification is provided indicating
    that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or
    the purpose of the research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization
    Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43). All investigators proposing
    clinical research should read the "NIH Guidelines for Inclusion of Women
    and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research” (</span><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html</a><span class="regulartext">);

    The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH definition of clinical
    research; updated racial and ethnic categories in compliance with the new OMB
    standards; clarification of language governing NIH-defined Phase III clinical
    trials consistent with the SF424 (R&amp;R) application; and updated roles and
    responsibilities of NIH staff and the extramural community. The policy
    continues to require for all NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials that: a) all
    applications or proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans
    to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by sex/gender
    and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable; and b)
    investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting analyses,
    as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic group differences. </span></p>

    NIH maintains a policy that children (i.e., individuals under the age of 21)
    must be included in all clinical research, conducted or supported by the NIH,
    unless there are scientific and ethical reasons not to include them. All
    investigators proposing research involving human subjects should read the

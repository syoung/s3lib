				<div class="entry entry-content">
					<p>I
read that at Google, engineers create a design document for just about
every project they work on. It led me to think about how I might
incorporate design documents into my usual work practices. I’m looking
for processes for teams of one or a few people. Here’s what I hope to
get out of a design document:</p>

<ul>
<li>Describe the requirements for the feature (or set of features) described by the design document.</li>
<li>Enable the writer to clarify their own thinking on the design of the feature being described.</li>
<li>Enable the person who’s requested the feature to be able to review the design to make sure their requirements are being met.</li>
<li>Enable other developers to review the design document to find flaws and suggest improvements.</li>
<li>Enable anybody who’s going to be working on the product a year down
the road to review the design document and figure out what the code
they’re working on is actually supposed to do.</li>
</ul>

<h2>UML</h2>

<p>So what goes into a design document and how do you structure it?  For a bit of guidance, I looked at the types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML diagrams</a>
that are available. I’m not a huge fan of UML, but the theory behind it
is that a full suite of diagrams models a system in its entirety.
Here’s how I rate the various diagrams in terms of their conceptual
utility. There may be better ways to represent the concepts in the
diagrams that UML.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram">Class diagram</a></td>
<td>Describes the objects in an object-oriented system and their relationships to one another. Indispensable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/componentDiagram.htm">Component diagram</a></td>
<td>Basically a higher level class diagram</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/compositeStructureDiagram.htm">Composite structure diagram</a></td>
<td>Not even the guy who documented it found it useful</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/deploymentDiagram.htm">Deployment diagram</a></td>
<td>Describes the actual deployment environment for an application.
Useful if you are speccing out deployment (or recommended deployment).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_diagram">Object diagram</a></td>
<td>Basically a class diagram with actual data filled in. A fancy word for “example”.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/packageDiagram.htm">Package diagram</a></td>
<td>Shows the components of a system at a higher level than the class diagram. Utility is marginal at best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/useCaseDiagram.htm">Use case diagram</a></td>
<td>I’m not in love with these diagrams, but the concept behind them is essential to design.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/activityDiagram.htm">Activity diagram</a></td>
<td>Some call it a flow chart. It’s hard to describe any complex design without something along these lines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/stateMachineDiagram.htm">State Machine diagram</a></td>
<td>More specific than an activity diagram, which is more specific than
a use case diagram. Useful when you’re modeling something too complex
to be captured in the activity diagram.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">Sequence diagram</a></td>
<td>Shows how messages are passed within a system. Only useful if generated from code. Too granular otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/communicationDiagram.htm">Communication diagram</a></td>
<td>Describes relationships between objects in a system in terms of the
messages they pass. Again, very granular, but a nice thing to have if
you can generate it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>I don’t want to dig too deeply into UML, but I did want to bring it
up because it’s somebody’s idea of how to describe a system. It’s
important to remember that the ideal use case for UML is in a system
where the diagrams are coupled with the code itself, so altering your
code updates the diagrams and vice versa. No programmer has enough time
to create all of those diagrams by hand and keep the diagrams in sync
with code as the system evolves over time. That’s not how UML is used,
ideally. Unfortunately, the UML tools that are out there have never
been compelling enough to me to bother with them.</p>

<h2>The Wikipedia Definition</h2>

<p>Wikipedia’s page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_document">design documents</a> is short and nominated for deletion. It lists four sections for such a document:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data design</li>
<li>Architecture design</li>
<li>Interface design</li>
<li>Procedural design</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t think that’s quite right either because it leaves out use
cases, which are necessary if you are serious about user experience. If
you don’t how who’s going to use your application and what they hope to
accomplish, you’re never going to get the interface right. So here’s a
stab at what I think a design document ought to contain.</p>

<h2>A Rough Draft</h2>

<p>So here are the elements that I think should appear in a design
document, even for a relatively small project. I don’t care whether
they are diagrams or narrative. Some things are better described in
pictures, but at the same time, some of us are better writers than
illustrators.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the value?</strong> Persuade the reader that the
feature is worth implementing in the first place. What’s the purpose?
Why are you writing it instead of using something that already exists?</p>

<p><strong>Use case analysis.</strong> Who will be using this feature
and why? If you’re writing a library, the users will be developers who
incorporate it into their own code. If you’re writing a Web
application, the user may be a customer who wants to buy something, or
a back office employee who’s fulfilling an order, or a writer who’s
trying to publish an article. Will this application be used by the same
people on a daily basis or will it be used only occasionally by a large
group of people? How knowledgeable are these users? UML provides a use
case diagram, but this is probably a section I’d prefer to write out.</p>

<p><strong>How is it supposed to work?</strong> A high level technical
overview of how the feature will be implemented. I’m not looking for
extreme detail here, just a high level overview of how the feature will
work in a technical sense. Are you writing this in Java, PHP, or Ruby
on Rails? Will you be using a relational database or flat files for
data storage? Are you going to integrate the components via a Web
service or are they parts of a single application? If it’s a Web
application, will you be using an MVC framework? Will you be using a
library to handle the persistence layer? The purpose of this section is
to give an idea of the scope of the project and what the risks are in
terms of completing it successfully. I can also use it to figure out
which members of the team might be able to apply their expertise to
this problem.</p>

<p><strong>What are the dependencies?</strong> You can figure out some
of the dependencies from the technical overview, but this section makes
the dependencies explicit. Is this project going to introduce a
dependency that we can’t rely on in the future? Are we about to build
something that the infrastructure people aren’t comfortable deploying?
Does anyone in the office know anything about the tools you’ve chosen
to implement this feature?</p>

<p><strong>What will be affected?</strong> Closely related to the
dependency question, this seeks to help everyone figure out what impact
this feature will have. Are we going to need to add more RAM to the
database server? Is it going to increase our bandwidth requirements?
Does it make our reports obsolete? This is one of those questions with
no authoritative answer, but the developer should try to anticipate the
impact of the feature they want to implement.</p>

<p><strong>Class diagram.</strong> If you’re not building an object-oriented system, then an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-relationship_diagram">entity-relationship diagram</a>
may make more sense. Either way, this diagram describes the structure
of your system at a low level. It documents which classes you need to
create, how they are represented in the database, and the relationships
between them.</p>

<p>How does that sound for a first draft for a design document?  What would you add? I expect to revisit this topic soon.</p>

			<p>Even
if you are building an OO system, you probably have a database, and you
probably want to document the schema with an ERD. Objects come and go,
but databases are forever…</p>

<p>I’ll give you an example: the Java application I wrote a couple of
years ago that interoperates with COBOL programs written 10-15 years
earlier does all of its communication through the database. There’s no
RPC of any kind between the two systems - one runs deep in the bowels
of an IBM mainframe, the other runs on a Windows PC server in
Websphere. Works great. The schema diagram from the previous system was
an important part of being able to write it (as was the ability to get
the database to describe the tables, and the ability to ask questions
of people knowledgeable about the previous system, but the schema
diagram was the main reference).</p>

<p>Other than that, I think you make sensible points. One of the nice
things about having a design document is that 2 weeks into a complex
set of changes you can look back and see what it is you’re really
trying to accomplish. This happens to me a depressingly large amount of
the time, that I’ll be deep in the guts of things making changes and
have lost track to some extent of what the goal is. Software is such a
malleable thing, knowing when to stop hammering it into a different
shape can be very hard.</p>

			<p>Wow.  A lot here.  I’m not a huge fan of UML either.  But I have two comments about your take.</p>

<p>First, you are too lenient about Use Case diagrams. They are
completely useless; more than that, they are almost harmful. The same
amount of paper with actual descriptions about the use cases (in text)
is much more helpful in my opinion. We’re all adults and can read; we
don’t need little stick figure people pointing at boxes to indicate a
“use” relationship. I believe these exist just to encourage people to
get <em>something</em> down for use cases.</p>

<p>And, I <em>completely disagree</em> about Sequence Diagrams. They
may be the most useful diagrams of the bunch. Any time there is a
temporal dependency between subsystems it is useful to model the
messaging using the sequence diagrams. While this may not be so common
for web apps, for distributed systems it is often crucial. Sequence
Diagrams are one of the few parts of UML that exist in every design doc
we do. They are very good at describing sequenced relationships, and
have been used a lot longer than UML has been around.</p>

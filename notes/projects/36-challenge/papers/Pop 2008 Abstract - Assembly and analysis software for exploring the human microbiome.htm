<p><b>Abstract: </b> DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacteria are
the most abundant organisms on Earth, yet little is known about most
members of this domain of life. Only about 1% of bacterial species can
be easily grown in culture, and considerably fewer have been sequenced.
Advances in sequencing technologies have made it possible to sequence
bacteria directly from the environment, providing a dramatic new
outlook on the diversity of bacteria populating our world. Initial
studies have explored the bacteria present in mines, ocean water, and
soil, as well as communities of commensal microbes that inhabit the
human body. The latter have provided a glimpse at the complex symbiotic
relationships between bacteria and their human hosts. Despite an
increased interest in environmental sequencing (metagenomics), few
specialized computational algorithms exist for the analysis of such
data. For example, the assembly of environmental data is being
performed with software originally intended for homogeneous DNA
sources, such as clonal bacterial populations or inbred eukaryotes.
These programs are ill-suited to the assembly of heterogeneous
microbial communities and numerous "hacks" have been necessary to
produce the assemblies published to date. This proposal aims to fill
the need for specialized software for assembling and finding genes in
metagenomic datasets. A particular focus will be on developing tools
for uncovering genomic variation within the assemblies of microbial
communities. The proposed software will specifically address issues
arising from the use of new sequencing technologies in metagenomic
projects. The low cost and high throughput of these technologies will
allow a far deeper exploration of the microbial biosphere than was
previously possible. Their broad application, however, depends on the
availability of software systems adapted to their specific
characteristics. In addition, new algorithms will be developed to allow
the individual components of a metagenomic analysis pipeline to be
tightly integrated, with the goal of improving the overall quality of
both assembly and annotation, and to facilitate the extraction of other
types of information from large sets of metagenomic data. The proposal
further aims to investigate the impact of experimental design and
choice of sequencing technology on the ability to assemble and analyze
metagenomic data, through the development of software for simulating
bacterial populations and emulating a variety sequencing strategies.
Better experimental design can reduce the high costs currently
associated with environmental sequencing and enhance subsequent
analyses. All software developed as part of this proposal, as well as
any simulated data and results of reanalyzing public datasets will be
released freely through public databases and open-source software
repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Initial
explorations of the communities of bacteria that inhabit our bodies
have already provided insights into the complex relationships between
microbes and the human host, as well as the contribution of bacteria to
diseases such as obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Many more
studies will be needed to help us fully understand the complex
human-microbe interactions and to translate these discoveries into new
therapies. The current proposal provides scientists with components of
the software infrastructure that will be essential for genomic studies
of the human microbiome. </p><p><b>Public Health Relevance: </b>

The TAMBIS Ontology</A>
</H2>

<P>
TAMBIS (Transparent Access to Multiple Bioinformatics Information Sources) uses 
an ontology to enable biologists to ask questions over multiple external 
databases  using a common query interface&nbsp;[<A href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~stevensr/onto/node17.html#baker98">1</A>]. The TAMBIS ontology 
(TaO)&nbsp;[<A href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~stevensr/onto/node17.html#baker99">19</A>] describes a wide range of  bioinformatics tasks and 
resources, and has a central role within the TAMBIS system.  

</P><P>
An interesting difference between the TaO and some of the other ontologies reviewed here, is 
that the TaO does not contain any instances. The TaO only contains knowledge 
about bioinformatics and molecular biology concepts and their relationships - 
the instances they represent still reside in the external databases.  As 
concepts represent instances, a concept can act as a question. The concept 
<TT>Receptor Protein</TT> represents the instances of proteins with a receptor 
function and gathering these instances is answering that question. 

</P><P>
The TaO is a dynamic ontology, in that it can grow without the need for either conceptualising or encoding new knowledge. In contrast, the other ontologies described here are static - developers must interveen and encode new conceptualisation to form new concepts. The TaO uses rules within the ontology to govern what concepts can be joined to another concept via relationships, to form new concepts.  Thus the TaO places great emphasis on relations.  A user can form a complex, multi-source query, using relationships, in the following manner.
Starting with the concept <TT>Protein</TT>, the TaO is consulted 
as to which relationships can be used to join <TT>Protein</TT> to other 
concepts. Amongst many, the following two are offered: <TT>is homologous to 
Protein</TT> and <TT>hasAccessionNumber AccessionNumber</TT>. Initially, the 
original Protein is extended to give a new concept <TT>Protein isHomologous 
to Protein</TT> (The concept <TT>Protein Protein homologue</TT>); then the second `protein&#39; is extended with 
<TT>hasAccessionNumber AccessionNumber</TT>. The resulting concept (`Protein homologue of Protein with Accession Number&#39;) describes  proteins which are homologous to protein with a particular accession number. 
This concept can be used as a source independent query containing no information on how 
to answer such a query. The rest of the TAMBIS system takes this conceptual 
query and processes it to an executable program against the external 
sources&nbsp;[<A href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~stevensr/onto/node17.html#paton99">20</A>].

</P><P>
The TaO is available in two forms - a small model that concentrates on proteins 
and a larger scale model that includes nucleic acids. The small TaO, with 250 
concepts and 60 relationships, describes Proteins and enzymes, as well as their 
motifs, secondary and tertiary structure, functions and processes. There is also 
supporting material on subcellular structure and chemicals, including cofactors.  
Motifs extend to detail such as the principal modification sites; function and 
process to broad classifications such as <TT>Hormone</TT> and <TT>Receptor</TT>, 
and <TT>Apoptosis</TT> and <TT>Lactation</TT>; structure extends to detail such 
as gross architecture - for example, <TT>SevenPropellor</TT>. Important 
relationships include <TT>is component of</TT>, <TT>has name</TT>, <TT>has 
function</TT> and <TT>is homologous to</TT>, as well as many more. The larger model, 
with 1500 concepts,  broadens these areas to include concepts pertinent to 
nucleic acid, its children and genes.

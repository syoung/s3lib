PERL VERSION
------------

3.9. Shift Operators
http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl2/prog/ch03_09.htm

The bit-shift operators (<< and >>) return the value of the left argument shifted to the left (<<) or to the right (>>) by the number of bits specified by the right argument. The arguments should be integers. For example:

1 << 4;     # returns 16
32 >> 4;    # returns 2
Be careful, though. Results on large (or negative) numbers may vary depending on the number of bits your machine uses to represent integers.




http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/PERL/node36.html



The Bitwise Operators

The bitwise operators are similar to the logical operators, except that they work on a smaller scale -- binary representations of data.

The following operators are available:

op1 & op2 -- The AND operator compares two bits and generates a result of 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
op1 | op2 -- The OR operator compares two bits and generates a result of 1 if the bits are complementary; otherwise, it returns 0.
op1^ op2 -- The EXCLUSIVE-OR operator compares two bits and returns 1 if either of the bits are 1 and it gives 0 if both bits are 0 or 1.
~op1 -- The COMPLEMENT operator is used to invert all of the bits of the operand.
op1 >> op2 -- The SHIFT RIGHT operator moves the bits to the right, discards the far right bit, and assigns the leftmost bit a value of 0. Each move to the right effectively divides op1 in half.
op1 << op2 -- The SHIFT LEFT operator moves the bits to the left, discards the far left bit, and assigns the rightmost bit a value of 0. Each move to the left effectively multiplies op1 by 2.
Note Both operands associated with the bitwise operator must be integers.

Bitwise operators are used to change individual bits in an operand. A single byte of computer memory-when viewed as 8 bits-can signify the true/false status of 8 flags because each bit can be used as a boolean variable that can hold one of two values: true or false. A flag variable is typically used to indicate the status of something. For instance, computer files can be marked as read-only. So you might have a $fReadOnly variable whose job would be to hold the read-only status of a file. This variable is called a flag variable because when $fReadOnly has a true value, it's equivalent to a football referee throwing a flag. The variable says, "Whoa! Don't modify this file."

When you have more than one flag variable, it might be more efficient to use a single variable to indicate the value of more than one flag. The next example shows you how to do this.

Example: Using the &, |, and ^ Operators

The first step to using bitwise operators to indicate more than one flag in a single variable is to define the meaning of the bits that you'd like to use. Figure 5.1 shows an example of 8 bits that could be used to control the attributes of text on a display.

 
The bit definition of a text attribute control variable

If you assume that $textAttr is used to control the text attributes, then you could set the italic attribute by setting $textAttr equal to 128 like this:

$textAttr = 128;
because the bit pattern of 128 is 10000000. The bit that is turned on corresponds to the italic position in $textAttr.

Now let's set both the italic and underline attributes on at the same time. The underline value is 16, which has a bit pattern of 00010000. You already know the value for italic is 128. So we call on the OR operator to combine the two values.

$textAttr = 128 | 16;
or using the bit patterns (this is just an example-you can't do this in Perl)

$textAttr = 10000000 | 00010000;
You will see that $textAttr gets assigned a value of 144 (or 10010000 as a bit pattern). This will set both italic and underline attributes on.

The next step might be to turn the italic attribute off. This is done with the EXCLUSIVE-OR operator, like so:

$textAttr = $textAttr ^ 128;

Example: Using the >> and << Operators

The bitwise shift operators are used to move all of the bits in the operand left or right a given number of times. They come in quite handy when you need to divide or multiply integer values.

This example will divide by 4 using the >> operator.

$firstVar = 128;

$secondVar = $firstVar >> 2;

print("$secondVar\n");
Here we

Assign a value of 128 to the $firstVar variable.
Shift the bits inside $firstVar two places to the right and
assign the new value to $secondVar .
Print the $secondVart variable.
The program produces the following output:

32
Let's look at the bit patterns of the variables before and after the shift operation. First, $firstVar is assigned 128 or 10000000. Then, the value in $firstVar is shifted left by two places. So the new value is 00100000 or 32, which is assigned to $secondVar.

The rightmost bit of a value is lost when the bits are shifted right. You can see this in the next example.

The next example will multiply 128 by 8.

$firstVar = 128;

$secondVar = $firstVar << 3;

print $secondVar;
The program produces the following output:
1024
The value of 1024 is beyond the bounds of the 8 bits that the other examples used. This was done to show you that the number of bits available for your use is not limited to one byte. You are really limited by however many bytes Perl uses for one scalar variable (probably 4). You'll need to read the Perl documentation that came with the interpreter to determine how many bytes your scalar variables use.

<entry [Wed Nov 24 11:18:38 EST 2010] cumulativeSnp.pl FAILURES DUE TO HARDWARE ISSUES>


PROBLEM:

cumulativeSnp.pl OCCASIONALLY DOES NOT INCORPORATE AN INPUT hit.bam FILE SUCH THAT THERE ARE TWO CONSECUTIVE merged-N.bam FILES WITH EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE AND COMPOSITION

cumulativeSnp.pl MERGES CONSECUTIVELY ALL OF THE hit.bam FILES FOR ALL 1-33 SAMPLES (EACH IS 100M READS, TOTAL 3.3 BILLION READS) AND THEN CALLS SNPS AT EACH STAGE



DIAGNOSIS:

THERE APPEARS TO BE A DELAY BETWEEN WHEN MERGE OUTPUT FILES ARE COMPLETED AND WHEN THEY BECOME 'AVAILABLE' ON THE FILE SYSTEM 

FOR EXAMPLE, RUNNING cumulativeSnp.pl ON NOVOALIGN hit.bam FILES, MERGING CUMULATIVELY RAN FINE FOR 4 FILES THEN FAILED AT FILE 5 BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS MERGED FILE WAS MISSING:

emacs cumulativeSnp-chr22-5-stdout.txt

    ...
    [bam_merge_core] fail to open file /scratch/syoung/base/pipeline/SRA/NA18507/SRP000239/sampled/200bp/chr22/novoalign/cumulative2/chr22/merged-4.bam
    ...

HOWEVER, THE merged-4.bam FILE IS ACTUALLY PRESENT:

cd /scratch/syoung/base/pipeline/SRA/NA18507/SRP000239/sampled/200bp/chr22/novoalign/cumulative2/chr22
ll merged-4.bam

    -rw-rw-rw- 1 syoung root 1.1G Nov 17 01:21 merged-4.bam


BUT THE merged-4.bam FILE WAS LAST WRITTEN TO AFTER THE APPLICATION HAD TERMINATED. I.E., THE merged-4.bam FILE IS DATED LATER THAN THE OUTPUT FILE:

cd /scratch/syoung/base/pipeline/SRA/NA18507/SRP000239/sampled/200bp/chr22/novoalign/cumulative2/chr22
ll cumulativeSnp-chr22-5-stdout.txt

    -rw-rw-rw- 1 syoung root 2.4K Nov 17 01:11 cumulativeSnp-chr22-5-stdout.txt


SOLUTION:

Actually there are a lot to say about paired-end mapping. This is where the accuracy of different aligners differs. The algorithms can be classified into four groups.

a) Eland-like strategy. Eland finds up to 10 equally best hits first and then check which pair (10x10 in total) is consistent. SSAHA2 uses a similar strategy, but seeing more top hits.

b) SOAP-like strategy. SOAP finds almost all the hits and then pair them. I do not know whether it may map a read to a suboptimal position if its mate is hanging around. I am sure SOAP-2.0.1 and BWA do this if necessary. You can say a) and b) are essentially the same, but only b) is useful to anchor reads in repeats.

c) MAQ-like strategy. MAQ does not find all the single-end hits first. It pairs the reads while doing the alignment. For programs indexing reads, this strategy is more effective and efficient than collecting all the single-end hits first.

d) We can map one end first and then do local alignment around the region pointed by the mapped reads. This strategy is usually combined with the previous. I believe NovoAlign/MAQ/BWA use this strategy as a complement to other strategies.

For short reads, proper pairing increases the coverage of the genome and substantially reduce false alignments.

The above is exactly right, although it may depend on the exact experiment. For example cancer sequencing we expect many translocations, or large-scale rearrangements, and preferring "paired reads" may reduce our power.

In general, if an aligner produces all hits for each end, any post-alignment filtering is possible (all the above classes). Of course some limit must be placed on the number of hits returned (thousands is overkill), since my 4 petabyte array of solid state hard drives has yet to arrive in the mail.

On the contrary, my experience is detecting structural variations (SVs) particularly presses for highly effective pairing. In the real world, abnormal pairs are most likely to be caused by false alignments rather than true SVs, which is also true for cancer genomes. And if a read can be paired with its mate, the alignment tends to be correct. I know several groups on detecting SVs put a lot of effort on getting more reads paired.

Whether keeping all hits is a debate. Surely we can recover anything, but the cost is considerable. How to use them effectively for SV detection is also an open question, I think. In addition, for effective pairing, keeping thousands of hits or keeping equally best hits only is not good enough. It is important to see sufficient suboptimal hits. NovoAlign is the most accurate aligner mainly because it sees many suboptimal hits and achieves highest pairing fraction.

Alignment accuracy is no so important for resequencing, but it is one of the most important factors for SV detection.

What I don't follow is if you align each end separately you will get the highest pairing fraction, since you are the very sensitive in this case (fewer constraints, in fact no constraints between each end). Furthermore, using one end to infer hits for the other can also increase sensitivity.

In my own experience, if one is sensitive enough, potentially false SVs (due to mapping) can be eliminated since by examining the secondary hits for each end, and seeing if there exists a pair of alignments for each end that fall within the expected insert size distribution that are not too much worse than the "best pair". Is this what you are talking about? If so, then we agree.

I would take exception to Novoalign being the most accurate, since this is conditional on sensitivity, as well as the many definitions of "accuracy".

Finally, I think you and I have a fundamental disagreement between what an aligner should do. I think it should return all hits for a given read that it can find (sensitivity), and let the user filter/choose the best alignment or alignment pair based on their experiment. I would prefer gapped smith-waterman, but this could vary based on experiment. Given this, I agree to disagree.

The aligner is but one step in the whole process, and everything shouldn't be lumped into the alignment algorithm.

SVA users need to prepare four (4) types of input files for an SVA project. All these files, except for type 3, can be generated from a pileup file, a format first used by Tony Cox and Zemin Ning at the Sanger Institute. This pileup file can be generated from software tools, for example, SAMtools, in a next-generation sequencing study. However, please note that the specific pileup format we used here is a bit different from the default SAMtools output format described here. Later in this page I will include detailed information and programs to generate those files.

Using SVA Analysis functions - Gene Prioritization
http://people.genome.duke.edu/~dg48/sva/analysis_genepri.php


The 'Gene Prioritization' function produces a list of protein coding genes that are 'knocked out' by homozygous variants in case genomes. This analysis prioritizes genes by the number of cases containing homozygous protein truncating or non-synonymous genetic variants, absent in control genomes. By this definition, different variants in the same gene are allowed and contribute equally to the ranking of this gene. In other words, this analysis tries to answer this simple question: do you see enrichment of protein-truncating (optionally, or non-synonymous) variants in any gene in the cases, when compared to control genomes?

Your SVA project must contain at least one case and one control for this function to work. Your SVA project must contain at least two cases for this function to reliably prioritize knocked out genes (with only one case, all homozygous knock out variants are listed but they all have the same liklihood of impacting case phenotype).



Function of genetic variant

This section allows you to select the types of 'knock out' variants you wish to include. The three options are:
'Protein truncation only'. This is the default setting and includes all homozygous variants that result in a premature trunction of a protein. Protein truncating mutations will always be included in the output.
'Including non-synonymous SNPs'. This setting includes both protein truncating variants and homozygous SNPs resulting in the change of an amino acid residue in the resulting protein.
'For non-synonymous SNPs: including only intolerable NS change'. This setting is supplementary to option number #2. When checked, an additional filter is applied to the non-synonymous SNPs by eliminating any 'tolerable' non-synonymous SNPs. Note: The status of an 'intolerable' non-synonymous SNP is determined using the MAPP software (http://mendel.stanford.edu/SidowLab/downloads/MAPP/index.html).



Criteria for homozygous variants

This section allows you to adjust the coverage you want to require for a homozygous variant. This will impact the number of variants that show up on your gene prioritization output. If you do not care about coverage (i.e. confidence) of the homozygous variants, you can uncheck 'Minimum coverage for a homozygous variant'. Otherwise the default parameters are set as follows: 
 	Number of sequencing reads
Autosomes (case):	10
Sex chromosomes (case):	5
Autosomes (control):	10
Sex chromosomes (control):	5


A brief explanation of default parameters for homozygous variants: 

In order to determine reliable default parameters, a number of whole genome sequence samples were analyzed for the coverage (read depth) distribution for confident 'homozygous' SNPs called by SAMtools. The coverage data was compared to the 1 million SNP chip data for the same sample. This analysis revealed the following:

Mistakenly called homozygous SNPs (defined by mismatch with 1M chip), had an average read depth of 7.03, with a median of 5.
Correctly called homozygous SNPs (defined by match with 1M chip), had an average read depth of 23.48, with a median of 24.
When a read depth threshold is not specified, 97.2% homozygous SNPs can be correctly called.
When a read depth threshold of >=10X is specified, then 99.30% homozygous SNPs can be correctly called.
These data suggest that a read depth threshold needs to be considered when you define a SNP as homozygous.  
If you want a lower false negative, but a relatively higher false positive (sensitivity is high), then use a lower threshold in cases but higher threshold in controls.
If you want a higher false negative, but a relatively lower false positive (specificity is high), then use a higher threshold in cases but lower threshold in controls.
Genetic model

This section allows you to select the genotype of the variant (heterozygous or homozygous) that you will allow to be present in your control genomes. The target variations in your cases are unaffected by this setting (still homozygous knock out variants).
'Recessive model (allowing for heterozygotes in controls)'. This is the default setting. This setting allows for any target variant to be present in control genomes in heterozygous form.
Alternately, you have an option to specify a model 'not allowing heterozygotes' in control genomes. This means that only target variants for which the control genomes are homozygous for the reference allele will appear on the Gene Prioritization output.
Control genomes

If 'check control samples for reference sequence' is unchecked, then all homozygous variants are listed, not just those unique to the cases. This function is disabled since you always want this function to check control samples for the reference sequence.
You may choose to 'Treat Venter's sequence as a control genome' by clicking the check box next to this option.

BAM FORMAT

(FROM SAMTOOLS PAPER)

Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) format To improve the performance,
we designed a companion format BAM, which is the binary representation of
SAM and keeps exactly the same information as SAM. BAM is compressed
by the BGZF library, a generic library developed by us to achieve fast
random access in a zlib-compatible compressed file. An example alignment
of 112Gbp of Illumina GA data requires 116GB of disk space (1.0 byte per
input base), including sequences, base qualities and all the meta information
generated by MAQ. Most of this space is used to store the base qualities.
Sorting and indexing A SAM/BAM file can be unsorted, but sorting
by coordinate is used to streamline data processing and to avoid loading
extra alignments into memory.

A position-sorted BAM file can be indexed.
We combine the UCSC binning scheme (Kent et al., 2002) and simple
linear indexing to achieve fast random retrieval of alignments overlapping
a specified chromosomal region.


In most cases, only one seek call is needed
to retrieve alignments in a region.


NB: LINEAR INDEXING IS A SIMPLE LOOKUP USING SUBSETS TO REDUCE TIME
http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2008/02/08/linear-indexing/


3 CONCLUSION
We designed and implemented a generic alignment format, SAM,
which is simple to work with and flexible enough to keep most
information from various sequencing platforms and read aligners.
The equivalent binary representation, BAM, is compact in size and
supports fast retrieval of alignments in specified regions. Using
positional sorting and indexing, applications can perform streambased
processing on specific genomic regions without loading the
entire file into memory. The SAM/BAM format, together with
SAMtools, separates the alignment step from downstream analyses,
enabling a generic and modular approach to the analysis of genomic
sequencing data.

Shen et al 2009
A SNP discovery method to assess variant allele probability from next-generation resequencing data


Currently, there are several methods available for detecting SNPs from NGS data, including Pyrobayes (Quinlan et al. 2008), POLYBAYES (Marth et al. 1999), MAQ (Li et al. 2008), SOAP (Li et al. 2009), VarScan (Ley et al. 2008; Koboldt et al. 2009), and other largely heuristic approaches (Wheeler et al. 2008). Pyrobayes-POLYBAYES recalibrates base-calling of all nucleotide positions from raw data, and then takes a Bayesian approach that incorporates the population polymorphism rates as priors to identify polymorphic sites.

**** MAQ uses the consensus of the aligned reads to identify SNPs. While MAQ is able to achieve high sensitivity, it can result in an expected high false-positive rate due to intrinsic high probabilities of sequencing errors in NGS data (Li et al. 2008).

VarScan and other available heuristic approaches that apply empirical covariate cutoffs can work well for specific projects, but become problematic with applications even with slight differences in underlying data.



MAQ SNP CALLING

from the PDF manual/published paper: maq for indels needs paired end reads. maps read 1, then does gapped alignment of read 2. maq indelpe will list the indels called from the read2 gapped alignment.


http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=554
try novocraft software if you want more indels from single end or paired end reads.



How are SNPs and indels called and filtered by SAMtools?
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/samtools/index.php?title=SAM_FAQ


By default, SNPs are called with a Bayesian model identical to the one used in MAQ. A simplified SOAPsnp model is implemented, too. Indels are called with a simple Bayesian model. The caller does local realignment to recover indels that occur at the end of a read but appear to be contiguous mismatches. For an example, see this picture.

http://samtools.sourceforge.net/images/seq2-156.png


The varFilter filters SNPs/indels in the following order:
d: low depth
D: high depth
W: too many SNPs in a window (SNP only)
G: close to a high-quality indel (SNP only)
Q: low root-mean-square (RMS) mapping quality (SNP only)
g: close to another indel with more evidence (indel only)
The first letter indicates the reason why SNPs/indels are filtered when you invoke varFilter with the `-p' option. A SNP/indel filtered by a rule higher in the list will not be tested against other rules.


I see `*' in the pileup sequence column. What are they?

A star at the sequence column represents a deletion. It is a place holder to make sure the number of bases at that column matches the read depth column. Simply ignore `*' if you do not use this information.




I only want to use a subset of alignments in pileup.

If you want to filter on mapping quality, flags, one read group or one library, you may just use the view command. If want to apply more complex filters, you may write an awk command for SAM. For example, I only want to use alignment with two or fewer differences (mismatches+gaps):
samtools view -h aln.bam | perl -ne 'print if (/^@/||(/NM:i:(\d+)/&&$1<=2))' | samtools pileup -S - > out.txt
or exclude all gapped alignments:
samtools view -h aln.bam | awk '$6!~/[ID]/' | samtools pileup -S -




I want to get `unique' alignments from SAM/BAM.

We prefer to say an alignment is `reliable' rather than `unique' as `uniqueness' is not well defined in general cases. You can get reliable alignments by setting a threshold on mapping quality:
samtools view -bq 1 aln.bam > aln-reliable.bam
You may want to set a more stringent threshold to get more reliable alignments.




MAQ PAPER
http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/11/1851.long
Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality scores

ITERATIVE MAPPING:

At the alignment stage, we should set the minimum base error probability as the rate of differences between the reference and the reads. However, this strategy is an approximation.

When there are differences between the reference and reads, the
best position might consistently give wrong alignments even if
there are no sequencing errors, which can invalidate the calculation
of mapping qualities.

It would be possible in an iterative
scheme to update the reference with an estimate of the new
sample sequence from the first mapping and then remap to the
updated reference.



DESCRIPTION OF COMPETITORS:


We also introduce a new statistical model for consensus genotype
calling and subsequent SNP calling. For capillary reads,
two different approaches have previously been taken to calling
SNPs. The first type of approach works on PCR resequencing data
from diploid samples. These algorithms directly examine chromatogram
trace files and detect variants by extracting or comparing
signals in the peaks of traces. The most widely used software
includes PolyPhred (Stephens et al. 2006), SNPdetector
(Zhang et al. 2005), and novoSNP (Weckx et al. 2005), each of
which can call the genotype of the sample as well as detect variants.
The second type of approach works for clone-based data.
They are usually built upon phred base calls and detect variants by
detecting base-pair differences between a read from a single haplotype
and the reference sequence. Two representative software
of this type are ssahaSNP (Ning et al. 2001) and PolyBayes (Marth
et al. 1999). While ssahaSNP uses a heuristic rule known as the
neighborhood quality standard (NQS) (Altshuler et al. 2000),
PolyBayes develops an explicit statistical framework to model
variants.

All new sequencing technologies are shotgun methods that
give sequences derived from a single molecule sampled from a
larger population. (Current methods amplify the starting template
by some form of PCR, but true single molecule methods are
expected in the future.) This means the methods for calling variants
from new technology data are most closely related to the
second group described above, including ssahaSNP and Poly-
Bayes. However, because of sampling and error rate, we need to
combine data from multiple reads. In practice, errors at a particular
site are correlated, and we must take this correlation into
account. This is analogous to calling a consensus from a sequence
assembly, and we propose a Bayesian approach to this issue that
is related to that used in assembly software CAP3 (Huang and
Madan 1999).

In summary, this article presents methods and software for
mapping short sequence reads to a reference genome, calculating
the probability of a read alignment being correct, and consensus
genotype calling with a model that incorporates correlated errors
and diploid sampling. The applicability and accuracy of the
methods are evaluated based on both real data from the bacterium
Salmonella paratyphi and simulated data from the diploid
human X chromosome.



MAQ OVERVIEW

Overview of MAQ algorithms

MAQ is a program that rapidly aligns short reads to the reference
genome and accurately infers variants, including SNPs and short
indels, from the alignment.

At the alignment stage, MAQ first searches for the ungapped
match with lowest mismatch score, defined as the sum of qualities
at mismatching bases. To speed up the alignment, MAQ only
considers positions that have two or fewer mismatches in the
first 28 bp (default parameters). Sequences that fail to reach a
mismatch score threshold but whose mate pair is mapped are
searched with a gapped alignment algorithm in the regions defined
by the mate pair.


To evaluate the reliability of alignments,
MAQ assigns each individual alignment a phred-scaled quality
score (capped at 99), which measures the probability that the true
alignment is not the one found by MAQ.

**** MAQ always reports a
single alignment, and if a read can be aligned equally well to
multiple positions, MAQ will randomly pick one position and
give it a mapping quality zero.

**** Because their mapping score is set
to zero, reads that are mapped equally well to multiple positions
will not contribute to variant calling. However, they do give information
on copy number of repetitive sequences and on the
fraction of reads that can be aligned to the genome, and can
easily be filtered out for downstream analysis if desired.


**** Mapping quality scores and mapping all reads that match the genome
even if repetitive are where MAQ differs from most other alignment
programs.

MAQ fully utilizes the mate-pair information of paired
reads. It is able to use this information to correct wrong alignments,
to add confidence to correct alignments, and to accurately
map a read to repetitive sequences if its mate is confidently
aligned. With paired-end reads, MAQ also finds short insertions/
deletions (indels) from the gapped alignment described above.

At the SNP calling stage, MAQ produces a consensus genotype
sequence from the alignment. The consensus sequence is
inferred from a Bayesian statistical model, and each consensus
genotype is associated with a phred quality that measures the
probability that the consensus genotype is incorrect.

Potential SNPs are detected by comparing the consensus sequence to the
reference and can be further filtered by a set of predefined rules.

These rules are designed to achieve the best performance on deep
human resequencing data and aim to compensate for simplifications
and assumptions used in the statistical model (e.g., treating
neighbor positions independently).




MAQ PAPER DISCUSSION


The reliability of short read alignments

The reliability of read alignments can substantially affect the accuracy
of the detection of variations. Knowing which alignment
is reliable is key to the subsequent analyses.

*** The most convenient way to measure the reliability is to define uniqueness: A read is
said to be uniquely mapped if its second best hit contains
more mismatches than its best hit.


Generally this simple criterion
works well, but potential difficulties are illustrated by the
following scenarios:
(1) a read has two one-mismatch hits, one
with a Q30 mismatch and the other with a Q3 mismatch;
(2) a read has one perfect hit and 100 one-mismatch hits;
(3) a read has a perfect hit and a Q3-mismatch hit.

In the first case,
although the read is not unique, the hit with a Q30 mismatch may
still be reliable. In the remaining two cases, although the read can
be uniquely aligned, the alignments are not reliable. For the human
genome, these types of scenarios may happen at times due
to the large fraction of repetitive sequences.

*** In our view, it is better to regard the position a read is
mapped to as a random variable, and the reliability of an alignment
can be naturally interpreted as the likelihood of the read
being mapped to the correct position. At this point, mapping
quality directly measures the reliability. It considers the repeat
structure of the reference and the base quality of read sequences,
which is implied in Equation 1 (see Methods), and can easily
handle the three cases shown above.




MAQ FALSE NEGATIVE AND FALSE POSITIVE

Unlike in an alignment, both FP and FN of SNPs on real data
can be estimated from other sources of data. FP can be evaluated
by capillary resequencing or genotyping a small subset of SNP
calls. FN can be estimated by comparing SNP calls to the wholegenome
chip-genotyping results. The fraction of chipgenotyping
polymorphic sites that are not found is the FN. It
should be noted that such a fraction is only the FN on the sites
where probes can be designed for the genotyping microarray.
These sites tend to be unique in the reference genome and are
usually easier to find by short-read resequencing. The overall FN
across the whole genome is higher.

In resequencing, it is also a good idea to explicitly define the
resequenceable regions (or the regions where SNPs can be confidently
called). We want to distinguish low SNP-density regions
from hard-to-resequence regions. Using MAQ, the fraction of the
human genome that is resequenceable with 35-bp reads is ?85%,
and with read pairs separated by 170 bp it is ?93%. Achieving
higher coverage would require a mixture of varying insert sizes
and longer reads.




MAQ PAIRED END ALIGNMENT ALGORITHM:


Methods

Single end read mapping
To map reads efficiently, MAQ first indexes read sequences and
scans the reference genome sequence to identify hits that are
extended and scored. With the Eland-like (A.J. Cox, unpubl.)
hashing technique, MAQ, by default, guarantees to find alignments
with up to two mismatches in the first 28 bp of the reads.
MAQ maps a read to a position that minimizes the sum of quality
values of mismatched bases.

**** If there are multiple equally
best positions, then one of them is chosen at random.


Paired-end read alignment
MAQ jointly aligns the two reads in a read pair and fully utilizes
the mate-pair information in the alignment.
In the paired-end alignment mode, MAQ will by default
build six hash tables for each end (12 tables in total).

**** In one round of indexing, MAQ indexes the first end with two templates
and the second end also with two templates. Four hash tables,
two for each end, will be put in memory at a time.

***** In the scan of the reference, when a hit of a read is found on the forward strand
of the reference sequence, MAQ appends its position to a queue
that always keeps the last two hits of this read on the forward
strand. When a hit of a read is found on the reverse strand, MAQ
checks the queue of its mate and tests whether its mate has a hit
on the forward strand within a maximum allowed distance ahead
of the current read. If there is one, MAQ will mark the two ends
as a pair. In this way, MAQ jointly maps the reads without independently
storing all the potential hits of each end.


****** For each end, MAQ will only hold in memory two hash
tables corresponding to two complementary templates (e.g.,
11110000 and 00001111 for 8-bp reads). This strategy guarantees
that any hit with no more than one mismatch can be always
found in each round of the scan. Holding more hash tables in
memory would help to find pairs containing more mismatches,
but doing this would also increase memory footprint.
Paired-end mapping qualities are derived from single end
mapping qualities.


********* There are two different cases when a pair can
be wrongly mapped.

In the first case, one of the two ends is
wrongly aligned and the other is correct. This scenario may happen
if a repetitive sequence appear twice or more in a short region.

In the second instance, a pair is wrong because both ends
are wrong at the same time.


In MAQ, if there is a unique pair mapping in which both
ends hit consistently (i.e., in the right orientation within the
proper distance), we give the mapping quality Qp = Qs1+Qs2 to
both reads, assuming independent errors. If there are multiple
consistent hit pairs, we take their single end mapping qualities as
the final mapping qualities.


Detecting short indels

MAQ first aligns reads with the ungapped alignment algorithm
described above and then finds short indels by utilizing matepair
information. Given a pair of reads, if one end can be mapped
with confidence but the other end is unmapped, a possible scenario
is that a potential indel interrupts the alignment of the
unmapped read. For this unmapped read, we can apply a standard
Smith-Waterman gapped alignment (Smith and Waterman
1981) in a region determined by the aligned read. The coordinate
and the size of the region is estimated from the distribution of all
the aligned reads by taking the mean separation of read pairs plus
or minus twice the standard deviation. As Smith-Waterman will
only be applied to a small fraction of reads in short regions,
efficiency is not a serious issue.




Consensus genotype calling
By default, MAQ assumes the sample is diploid. It calculates the
posterior distribution of genotypes and calls the genotype that
maximizes the posterior probability.
Before consensus calling, MAQ first combines mapping
quality and base quality. If a read is incorrectly mapped, any
sequence differences inferred from the read cannot be reliable.
Therefore, the base quality used in SNP calling cannot exceed the
mapping quality of the read. MAQ reassigns the quality of each
base as the smaller value between the read mapping quality and
the raw sequencing base quality.
We first calculate the probability of data given each possible
genotype. In consensus calling, if there are no sequencing errors,
at most two different nucleotides can be legitimately seen. Therefore,
we can consider only the two most frequent nucleotides at
any position and ignore others as errors. Assume we are observing
data D which consist of k nucleotides b and n-k nucleotides
b' with b,b'?{A,C,G,T} and b ' b'. Then the three possible genotypes
are ?b,b?, ?b,b'?, and ?b',b'?. If the true genotype is ?b,b?, we
have n-k errors from n bases. Let the probability of observing

these errors be alpha n,n-k, and therefore P(D|?b,b?) = alpha n,n-k. Similarly we
have P(D|?b',b'?) = alpha nk. If the true genotype is ?b,b'?, the probability
can be approximated with a binomial distribution:
P(D|?b,b'?) = (nk
)/2n.
If we further assume the prior of genotypes is
P(?b,b?) = P(?b',b'?) = (1 - r)/2 and P(?b,b'?) = r, we can calculate
the posterior probability P(g|D) of genotype g given the observation
D. Then the estimated genotype is g = argmaxgP(g|D) with a
quality Qg = -10log10[1 - P(g|D)]. Here r is the probability of
observing a heterozygote. We usually use r = 0.001 for the discovery
of new SNPs and r = 0.2 for inferring genotypes at known
SNP sites. In principle, a site-specific r can be used given known
allele frequencies.

The real difficulty is to calculate alpha nk, the probability of k
errors observed from n nucleotides. If errors arise independently
and error rates are identical for all bases, alpha nk can be calculated
with a binomial distribution. When errors are correlated and not
identical, MAQ approximates alpha nk by

ank ? cnk theta i=0
k?1
epsilon i+1
 theta i . (2)

Where epsilon i is the ith smallest base error probability and c'nk is a
function of epsilon i but varies little with epsilon i.


**** The only unknown parameter is  theta , which controls the dependency of errors.

The deduction
of this equation and the calculation of c'nk will be presented in
the Supplemental material.


Taking a form like Equation 2 is inspired by CAP3 (Huang
and Madan, 1999), where  theta  is arbitrarily set to 0.5. In principle,  theta 
can be estimated from real data. In practice, however, the estimate
is complicated by the requirement of large data set where
SNPs are known, by the inaccuracy of sequencing qualities, by
the dependencies of mapping qualities, and also by the approximation
made to derive the equation. To estimate  theta , we just tried
different values and selected the one that was giving the best
final genotype calls.


**** We found  theta  = 0.85 is a reasonable value for
Illumina Genetic Analyzer data.

Extract SNP sites. Each line consists of chromosome, position, reference base, consensus base, Phred-like consensus quality, read depth, the average number of hits of reads covering this position, the highest mapping quality of the reads covering the position, the minimum consensus quality in the 3bp flanking regions at each side of the site (6bp in total), the second best call, log likelihood ratio of the second best and the third best call, and the third best call.

The 5th column is the key criterion when you judge the reliability of a SNP. However, as this quality is only calculated assuming site independency, you should also consider other columns to get more accurate SNP calls. Script command maq.pl SNPfilter is designed for this (see below).

The 7th column implies whether the site falls in a repetitive region. If no read covering the site can be mapped with high mapping quality, the flanking region is possibly repetitive or in the lack of good reads. A SNP at such site is usually not reliable.

The 8th column roughly gives the copy number of the flanking region in the reference genome. In most cases, this number approaches 1.00, which means the region is about unique. Sometimes you may see non-zero read depth but 0.00 at the 7th column. This indicates that all the reads covering the position have at least two mismatches. Maq only counts the number of 0- and 1-mismatch hits to the reference. This is due to a complex technical issue.

The 9th column gives the neighbouring quality. Filtering on this column is also required to get reliable SNPs. This idea is inspired by NQS, although NQS is initially designed for a single read instead of a consensus.

SNPfilter	maq.pl SNPfilter [-d minDep] [-D maxDep] [-Q maxMapQ] [-q minCnsQ] [-w indelWinSize] [-n minNeiQ] [-F in.indelpe] [-f in.indelsoa] [-s minScore] [-m maxAcross] [-a] [-N maxWinSNP] [-W densWinSize] in.cns2snp.snp > out.filtered.snp

Rule out SNPs that are covered by few reads (specified by -d), by too many reads (specified by -D), near (specified by -w) to a potential indel, falling in a possible repetitve region (characterized by -Q), or having low-quality neighbouring bases (specified by -n). If maxWinSNP or more SNPs appear in any densWinSize window, they will also be filtered out together.

    OPTIONS:
    -d INT	 Minimum read depth required to call a SNP [3]
    -D INT	 Maximum read depth required to call a SNP (<255, otherwise ignored) [256]
    -Q INT	 Required maximum mapping quality of reads covering the SNP [40]
    -q INT	 Minimum consensus quality [20]
    -n INT	 Minimum adjacent consensus quality [20]
    -w INT	 Size of the window around the potential indels. SNPs that are close to indels will be suppressed [3]
    -F FILE	 The indelpe output [null]
    -f FILE	 The indelsoa output [null]
    -s INT	 Minimum score for a soa-indel to be considered [3]
    -m INT	 Maximum number of reads that can be mapped across a soa-indel [1]
    -a	 Alternative filter for single end alignment

INDEL CALLING - CLUSTERED SNPS REMOVED BY REALIGNMENT
http://www.broadinstitute.org/files/shared/mpg/nextgen2010/nextgen_sivachenko.pdf

The magnitude of the problem
SNP Calling: Bayesian SNP caller on 10Mb of merged pilot 1
(low coverage) reads for CEU individuals
 There were 74,363 total SNPs called in the region
 Of those SNPS, 36,438 (49%) occurred in clusters
(cluster = 2 or more SNPs within 10bp)
 About half the SNP calls are ignored with nave filtering!
 Nearby clusters (i.e. less than a read length away) were merged
 There were 3,356 total clusters a/er merging
 30% of the SNP clusters were removed by realignment

CASAVA/ILLUMINA SNP CALLER

http://www.illumina.com/Documents/products/technotes/technote_snp_caller_sequencing.pdf

CASAVA ALGORITHM:

USES ONLY THESE READ PAIRS:

    NORMAL READS (NO ANOMALOUS PAIRS OR UNPAIRED 'ORPHAN' READS)
    WITHIN 3 STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF EXPECTED GAP SIZE
    CORRECT ORIENTATION
    MINIMUM ALIGNMENT SCORE = 6


CALCULATE ALLELE SCORE 

    1. FOR ALL BASES, CALCULATE E.G. FOR A = log10 P(observed base| no "As" present) 
    2. SUBTRACT LOWEST SCORE FROM OTHER THREE
    3. CONVERT TO LOG-ODDS SCORE, SCORE OF 3 =  PHRED SCORE OF 30
    
SNP CALLING

CALL SNP IF ALLELE SCORE > 10 AND COVERAGES < 3 TIMES CHROMOSOMAL AVERAGE
DEFINED AS HETERZYGOT IF BOTH ALLELES HAVE ALLELE SCORE > 10 AND RATIO OF THEIR SCORES <= 3




CASAVA DRAWBACKS

SNP CALLER NEEDS 30X COVERAGE OR MORE (15X PER HAPLOID ALLELE)

INDELS THAT ARE MISCALLED AS SNPS CAN BE RECOGNIZED BY A DROP IN COVERAGE (ELAND CAN'T DEAL WITH GAPS)

CASAVA 1.0 ONLY USES GENOME REFERENCE FOR SNP CALLING SO ALLELE FREQUENCIES FOR RNA SNPS CLOSE TO SPLICE SITE MAY BE INACCURATE

BY DEFAULT, CASAVA 1.0 DOES NOT CALL SNPS IN HIGH COPY REGIONS (NOT DESIRABLE IN SAY CANCER RESEARCH)



NOTES
-----



http://i.seqanswers.com/question/209/samtools-pileup-snp-quality-distribution

I'll take a stab at this, but I've only briefly looked at the supplemental data in the original MAQ paper (this is the same method for SNP calling used by samtools pileup).

The SNP quality is determined using an estimate of the probabilities. Their estimation only has a certain amount of resolution (because nucleotide counts are always integers), so this is not a continuous function. The phred-like score is likewise not continuous (it gets rounded to an integer), but the number of nucleotides and the SNP quality will be on different scales, resulting in the "divisible by 3" feature you noticed. If the SNP quality and nucleotide counts could be fractional that would likely be pretty smooth. As far as the spikes at 228 and 30, I'm not entirely sure where those come from. With the kind of probability estimation they're using there are often edge cases (when both have equal numbers of reads, when one has exactly one read, when there's only two reads total, etc.) and it's possible that those edge cases get rounded to those particular scores, resulting in their over-representation. I would look to see if the SNPs generating those scores have anything in common.



Samtools pileup SNP quality distribution

The docs say the SNP quality column contains the:

Phred-scaled likelihood that the genotype is identical to the reference, which is also called `SNP quality'. Suppose the reference base is A and in alignment we see 17 G and 3 A. We will get a low consensus quality because it is difficult to distinguish an A/G heterozygote from a G/G homozygote. We will get a high SNP quality, though, because the evidence of a SNP is very strong.

THE FILE 1 hit.sap IS 5.3 MB:

<entry [Fri Nov 12 13:40:10 EST 2010] MAQ snpFilter CRITERIA>


MAQ (Multiple Alignments with Qualities) produces a highly-filtered output file of SNP predictions called 'out.SNPfilter'. 

The file columns in the out.SNPfilter file are as follows:

{quote}
# Chromosome
# Position
# Reference base
# Consensus base
# Consensus quality
(A Phred-like quality value. Considered the key criterion for judging the reliability of a SNP.)
# Read depth
# Repetitive region
(Average number of hits of reads covering this position. Indicates whether the site falls in a repetitive region. If no read 
covering the site can be mapped with high mapping quality, the flanking region is possibly repetitive or in the lack of good 
reads. A SNP at such site is usually not reliable.)
# Highest mapping quality
(Highest mapping quality of the reads covering the position. Roughly gives the copy number of the flanking region in the 
reference genome. In most cases, this number approaches 1.00, which means the region is about unique. Sometimes you may see 
non-zero read depth but 0.00 at the 7th column. This indicates that all the reads covering the position have at least two 
mismatches. Maq only counts the number of 0- and 1-mismatch hits to the reference. This is due to a complex technical issue.)
# Min. flanking quality
(Minimum consensus quality in the 3bp flanking regions at each side of the site (6bp in total). This gives the neighbouring 
quality. Filtering on this column is also required to get reliable SNPs. This idea is inspired by NQS, although NQS is 
initially designed for a single read instead of a consensus.)
# Second best call
# Log likelihood ratio of the second best and the third best call 
# Third best call

<entry [Tue Nov  9 12:27:10 EST 2010] COMPARE ELAND AND ELAND2>

SAME HEAD AND TAIL BUT SAM FILES ARE NOT IDENTICAL. E.G., ELAND2 IS 415 MB AND
ELAND IS 397 MB:

cd /scratch/syoung/base/pipeline/SRA/NA18507/SRP000239/sampled/200bp

    -rw-rw-rw- 1 syoung root 397M Oct 13 14:43 autochr22/eland/10/chr22/hit.sam

    -rw-rw-rw- 1 syoung root 415M Nov  6 11:11 chr22/eland/10/chr22/hit.sam


DIFFERENCE IS THAT ELAND2 SAM FILE ENTRIES HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TAG: AS:i:0

DIFF OF IDS SHOWS THAT hit.sam FILES ARE IDENTICAL IN TERMS OF READ IS:

CONTINUATION OF:
[
Thu Nov  4 12:29:48 EDT 2010
RERUN BOWTIE chr22 WITH DEFAULTS
]

PROBLEM: BOWTIE RUN WITH --rf OPTION ON 3.3 BILLION READS PRODUCED SMALL hit.sam FILE

CONCLUSION: MUST RERUN BOWTIE FLAG WITH 3.3 BILLION READS USING '--fr' FLAG

FIRST RUN DEFAULT FOR COMPARISON. NOW RUN WITH --fr FLAG

SAM FORMAT
----------


The alignment section consists of multiple TAB-delimited lines with each line describing an alignment. Each line is:

    <QNAME> <FLAG> <RNAME> <POS> <MAPQ> <CIGAR> <MRNM> <MPOS> <ISIZE> <SEQ> <QUAL> \
    [<TAG>:<VTYPE>:<VALUE> [...]]

The format of each field is explained in the following table. More detailed descriptions are given in the sections below.

Field Regular expression Range Description

    QNAME [^ \t\n\r]+ Query pair NAME if paired; or Query NAME if unpaired 2
    FLAG [0-9]+ [0,216-1] bitwise FLAG (Section 2.2.2)
    RNAME [^ \t\n\r@=]+ Reference sequence NAME 3
    POS [0-9]+ [0,229-1] 1-based leftmost POSition/coordinate of the clipped sequence
    MAPQ [0-9]+ [0,28-1] MAPping Quality (phred-scaled posterior probability that the mapping
    position of this read is incorrect) 4
    CIGAR ([0-9]+[MIDNSHP])+|\* extended CIGAR string
    MRNM [^ \t\n\r@]+ Mate Reference sequence NaMe; = if the same as <RNAME> 3
    MPOS [0-9]+ [0,229-1] 1-based leftmost Mate POSition of the clipped sequence
    ISIZE -?[0-9]+ [-229,229] inferred Insert SIZE 5
    SEQ [acgtnACGTN.=]+|\* query SEQuence; = for a match to the reference; n/N/. for ambiguity;
    cases are not maintained 6,7
    QUAL [!-~]+|\* [0,93] query QUALity; ASCII-33 gives the Phred base quality 6,7
    TAG [A-Z][A-Z0-9] TAG
    VTYPE [AifZH] Value TYPE
    VALUE [^\t\n\r]+ match <VTYPE> (space allowed)

Notes:

1. QNAME and FLAG are required for all alignments. If the mapping position of the query is not available, RNAME and
CIGAR are set as *, and POS and MAPQ as 0. If the query is unpaired or pairing information is not available, MRNM
equals *, and MPOS and ISIZE equal 0. SEQ and QUAL can both be absent, represented as a star *. If QUAL is
not a star, it must be of the same length as SEQ.
2. The name of a pair/read is required to be unique in the SAM file, but one pair/read may appear multiple times in
different alignment records, representing multiple or split hits. The maximum string length is 254.
3. If SQ is present in the header, RNAME and MRNM must appear in an SQ header record.
4. Field MAPQ considers pairing in calculation if the read is paired. Providing MAPQ is recommended. If such a
calculation is difficult, 255 should be applied, indicating the mapping quality is not available.
5. If the two reads in a pair are mapped to the same reference, ISIZE equals the difference between the coordinate of
the 5?-end of the mate and of the 5?-end of the current read; otherwise ISIZE equals 0 (by the 5?-end we mean the
5?-end of the original read, so for Illumina short-insert paired end reads this calculates the difference in mapping
coordinates of the outer edges of the original sequenced fragment). ISIZE is negative if the mate is mapped to a
smaller coordinate than the current read.
6. Color alignments are stored as normal nucleotide alignments with additional tags describing the raw color
sequences, qualities and color-specific properties (see also Note 5 in section 2.2.4).
7. All mapped reads are represented on the forward genomic strand. The bases are reverse complemented from the
unmapped read sequence and the quality scores and cigar strings are recorded consistently with the bases. This
applies to information in the mate tags (R2, Q2, S2, etc.) and any other tags that are strand sensitive. The strand
bits in the flag simply indicates whether this reverse complement transform was applied from the original read
sequence to obtain the bases listed in the SAM file.



2.2.2. The <flag> field
Field <flag> is a bitwise flag. The meaning of predefined bits is shown in the following table:


Flag Description

0x0001 the read is paired in sequencing, no matter whether it is mapped in a pair
0x0002 the read is mapped in a proper pair (depends on the protocol, normally inferred during alignment) 1
0x0004 the query sequence itself is unmapped
0x0008 the mate is unmapped 1
0x0010 strand of the query (0 for forward; 1 for reverse strand)
0x0020 strand of the mate 1
0x0040 the read is the first read in a pair 1,2
0x0080 the read is the second read in a pair 1,2
0x0100 the alignment is not primary (a read having split hits may have multiple primary alignment records)
0x0200 the read fails platform/vendor quality checks
0x0400 the read is either a PCR duplicate or an optical duplicate

Notes:
1. Flag 0x02, 0x08, 0x20, 0x40 and 0x80 are only meaningful when flag 0x01 is present.
2. If in a read pair the information on which read is the first in the pair is lost in the upstream analysis, flag 0x01 should
be present and 0x40 and 0x80 are both zero.


SAM TAGS
--------

What are TAGs?
TAGs are optional fields on a SAM/BAM Alignment. A TAG is comprised of a two character TAG key, they type of the value, and the value:

[A-Za-z][A-za-z]:[AifZH]:.*

The types, A, i, f, Z, H are used to indicate the type of value stored in the tag.

		Type	Description
		A	character
		i	signed 32-bit integer
		f	single-precision float
		Z	string
		H	hex string

There are a set of predefined tags that are general used in Alignments. They are documented in the SAM Specification.

Predefined tags have been specified for storing information about the read or alignment. Examples of things stored in predefined tags:

Previous settings for various fields if they have been updated due to additional processing
Mappings from the alignment to Header values, used to match to a read group or program.

Additional information which may already be in the header like library and platform.

A user can also use any additional tags to store any information they want. TAGs starting with X, Y, or Z are reserved to be user defined.



Examples:

XT:A:U  - user defined tag called XT.  It holds a character.  The value associated with this tag is 'U'.
NM:i:2  - predefined tag NM means: Edit distance to the reference (number of changes necessary to make this equal the reference, excluding clipping)

What Information is in the SAM/BAM Header

The SAM/BAM header is not required, but if it is there, it contains generic information for the SAM/BAM file.
The header may contain the version information for the SAM/BAM file and information regarding whether or not and how the file is sorted.
It also contains supplemental information for alignment records like information about the reference sequences, the processing that was used to generate the various reads in the file, and the programs that have been used to process the different reads. The alignment records may then point to this supplemental information identifying which ones the specific alignment is associated with.
For example, a group of reads in the SAM/BAM file may all be assigned to the same reference sequence. Rather than every alignment containing information about the reference sequence, this information is put in the header, and the alignment "points" to the appropriate reference sequence in the header via the RNAME field. The header contains generic information about this reference like its length.

The SAM/BAM Header also may contain comments which are free-form text lines that can contain any information.

Header lines start with an '@'.

In the alignment examples below, you will see that the 2nd alignment maps back to the RG line with ID UM0098.1, and all of the alignments point back to the SQ line with SN:1 because their RNAME is 1.

NOVOALIGN OPTIONS
-----------------


http://www.novocraft.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Reporting+Multiple+Alignments+per+Read&structure=Novocraft+Technologies&page_ref_id=41

BY DEFAULT, NOVOALIGN DOES NOT REPORT ANY ALIGNMENT OTHER THAN THE BEST ALIGNMENT


http://www.novocraft.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Novoalign%20command%20line%20Options

Options for reporting:

-o format	Specifies the report format. Native, Pairwise & SAM. Default is Native.

-R 99	Sets score difference between best and second best alignment for calling a repeat. Default 5.

-r strategy [limit]	Sets strategy for reporting repeats. 'None', 'Random', 'All', 'Exhaustive', or a posterior probability limit. Default None.
        An optional limit on the maximum number of alignments to report can also be set. Default is no limit. 
        When using the 'Exhaustive' option a limit and an alignment threshold must be set.

-Q 99	Sets lower limit on alignment quality for reporting. Default 0.

-e 999	Sets a limit on number of alignments for a single read. This limit applies to the number of alignments with score equal to that of the best alignment. Alignment process will stop when the limit is reached. Default 1000 in default report mode, off for other modes.

-q 9	Sets number of decimal places for quality score. Default zero.

-K [file]	Collects mismatch statistics for quality calibration by position in the read and called base quality. Mismatch counts are written to the named file after all reads are processed. When used with -k option the mismatch counts include any read from the input quality calibration file.




NOVOALIGN
Reporting Multiple Alignments per Read

http://www.novocraft.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Reporting+Multiple+Alignments+per+Read&structure=Novocraft+Technologies&page_ref_id=41
      

Novoalign is quite flexible when it comes to reporting reads that have multiple alignment loci.

The default option is to report no locus if the posterior alignment probability of the best alignment is less than 0.7.
Other options are:
Randomly selecting a single alignment locus from the set loci. The probability of a locus being chosen is equal to it's posterior alignment probability. Behaviour is similar to MAQ & BWA.
Reporting all alignments where alignment score is within a certain range of the best alignment.
Reporting all alignments below a score threshold.
Reporting all alignment loci with posterior alignment probability over a user defined limit.

For above options that report multiple alignments you can also set a limit on the maximum number of alignment loci to report.

Command Line Options


-r method [limit] [-t threshold]


Sets the rules for handling of reads with multiple alignment locations.


Values are:-

Method	Limit	-t threshold	Description
None	NA	Optional	No alignments will be reported. The read will be reported as a type R with no alignment locations. A reporting "limit" should not be set.
Random	NA	Optional	A single alignment location is randomly chosen from amongst all the alignment results. A reporting "limit" should not be set.
All	Optional	Optional	All alignment locations are reported. The 'All' method can optionally specify a limit for the number of lines reported. e.g. '-r All 10' will report at most 10 randomly selected alignments.
Exhaustive	Required	Required	Reports all alignments with a alignment score, P(R|Ai) , less than or equal to the threshold. The 'Exhaustive' method requires that a limit for the number of lines reported. e.g. '-r E 10' will report at most 10 randomly selected alignments per read. This is to avoid situations where high copy number repeats result in reporting millions of alignments for a read. The alignment threshold (-t option) must be set when using the -r Exhaustive option.
0.99	NA	Optional	Posterior probability threshold. All alignments with posterior probability greater than the set value will be reported.


-R "99"


Specifies a score difference between first two alignments for reporting repeats. If the difference is less than this then the read is treated as aligning to a repeat and '-r method' applies. If the score difference is greater than this then the higher scoring alignment is reported as a unique alignment. Default is 5 and corresponds approximately to first alignment having a probability of 0.75 and the second a probability of 0.25.

The following table shows approximate alignment probabilities for different settings in case when two alignments have been found. If the posterior alignment probability of the first alignment is below the P(1st) value then the alignment will be classed as a repeat.

Score Difference	P(1st)	P(2nd)
5	0.760	0.240
10	0.909	0.091
20	0.990	0.010
30	0.999	0.001



Examples

novoalign -r Ex 10 -t 180 -d ...	 Reports up to 10 alignments per read having alignment score less than 180. If more than 10 alignments found then they are chosen randomly from the lowest scoring alignments.
novoalign -r All -d ...	            Reports all alignments with a score within 5 points of the best alignment.
novoalign -r All -R 30 -d ...	    Reports all alignments with a score within 30 points of the best alignment.
novoalign -r All 20 -R 30 -d ...	Reports no more than 20 alignments with a score within 30 points of the best alignment.
novoalign -r Random -R30 -d ...	    Reports a randomly selected alignment from all alignments with a score within 30 points of the best alignment. The probability of an alignment being selected is proportional to its posterior alignment probability.
novoalign -d ...	                Default reporting option is to report only unique alignments. A unique alignment has a posterior probability > 0.75
novoalign -r 0.05	                Reports all alignments with a posterior alignment probability greater than 0.05. This option is quite different in effect to the other options, if a read aligns to, say, 50 locations with same score then each will have a posterior probability of 0.02 and no alignments are reported. However, if it aligned to 10 locations with the same score then they would each have a probability of 0.1 and they would all be reported.

ELAND -- ALREADY DONE (REPORTS UNIQUE HITS ONLY BY DEFAULT - *_export.txt)

BOWTIE -- ALREADY DONE (REPORTS UNIQUE HITS ONLY BY DEFAULT)
-k <int>
Report up to <int> valid alignments per read or pair (default: 1). Validity of alignments is determined by the alignment policy (combined effects of -n, -v, -l, and -e). If more than one valid alignment exists and the --best and --strata options are specified, then only those alignments belonging to the best alignment "stratum" will be reported. Bowtie is designed to be very fast for small -k but bowtie can become significantly slower as -k increases.

ELAND OPTIONS
-------------

http://bioit.dbi.udel.edu/manuals/GAPipeline/Whole_genome_alignments_using_ELAND

Running ELAND as a standalone program

	This has changed for 0.4
The eland_extended and eland_pair modes introduced in Pipeline version 0.3 share a common 'export' file format. The intention of this file is to combine all the important information for a lane into one file (or two files in the case of a paired read run). These scripts:

Bring in the base quality value information
Use the base quality values to pick the best alignment (taking into account read-pairing if relevant)
Give a quality score to the alignment
You do not get these files just by running the ELAND executable, the export files are generated by running several scripts to postprocess the raw ELAND output.
There seems to be an increasingly common requirement to run this set of scripts in a 'standalone' fashion. This can be done via the script Pipeline/Eland/ELAND_standalone.pl. Minimal usage:

./Pipeline/Eland/ELAND_standalone.pl -if read1.fastq -if read2.fastq -it fastq
-eg /lustre/data01/Mondas_software/Genomes/E_coli_ELAND
Full list of options:

option	short form	Description
--input-file	-if	must specify at least one file, specify two for paired analysis
--input-type	-it	type of input file: fastq, fasta or export
--read-length	-rl	will work it out from input file(s) if not specified
--seed-length	-sl	length of read used for ELAND alignment - default is to min of read-length and 32
--eland-genome	-eg	full path of a squashed genome directory
--output-prefix	-op	will produce a set of output files whose names prefixed by this - defaults to 'reanalysis'
--pipeline-dir	-pd	path of pipeline installation to call - by default, looks in same dir as executable is found
--base-quality	-bq	in fasta mode assume all bases have this quality (TBD)
--pair-params	-pp	paired read analysis parameters to pass to pickBestPair - multiple arguments must go in quotes - defaults to '--circular' - treats all chromosomes as circular
NB: for a paired read analysis, both reads must share same
input-type, read-length and seed-length


TBDs:

As of today (5.3.8), -it fasta doesn't work. You'll have to fake a fastq file with a constant base quality value of your choice.
I want to add in a partial reanalysis capability to do things like varying the filtering without having to do the whole realignment.
It doesn't do quality value recalibration at the moment (5.3.8), because that code is subject to change. It will do 'soon.'
For a paired-read run, the ELAND alignment of the two reads could be run in parallel to halve the time to result (assuming you have at least 2 cores free, as even your iPod probably does these days). It doesn't do this yet, it could.

ELAND_standalone is meant for:

Quickly testing effect of different filter parameters
Quickly testing alignment targets (e.g. align to genome + contaminants to check for contaminants).
Testing applications that read export files.
Quickly testing pipeline components (for internal use)
If you want to e.g. produce a set of export files for submission then it is probably best to re-run GERALD part of the pipeline to get a 'proper' analysis.

Pitfall:
It uses 'our' fastq encoding scheme (ASCII character = quality value + 64) rather than the more standard ASCII character = quality value + 32

A quick and dirty conversion from 'rest of the world' to 'us' can be done by

 
cat file.fastq | perl -lane '{ if ($l=~/^\+/) { s/(.)/chr(ord($1)+32)/eg;} print; $l=$_ }' > new.fastq
I propose to make ELAND_standalone.pl part of the 0.4 release as several of our informed external users have asked for it and it can't break the existing pipeline code to do so.

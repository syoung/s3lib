About my startup plan: ValuedMe provides free services and premium value-added services for individuals who have their DNA sequence or genetic markers. All services will be provided through the ValuedMe website and mobile application. The free services include a basic genetic health risk profile, a breakdown of the customer's ancestry and inclusion in cohorts of individuals with similar disease risk profiles. Cohorts are challenged to take steps to reduce their specific risk (e.g., heart disease, asthma, diabetes) and to share information about the efficacy of drug and non-drug treatment regimens. A game-based approach and peer encouragement will improve the customer's chances of successfully maintaining good habits to reduce their risk within their cohort. The premium services include advanced genetic analysis, genetic matchmaking, fertility and offspring health prediction.

ValuedMe

Executive Summary

ValuedMe offers free services and premium value-added services for individuals who have their DNA sequence or genetic markers. All services will be provided through the ValuedMe website and mobile application. There are three free services: 1) a genetic health profile alerting the individual to potential disease risks, 2) optional inclusion in cohorts of individuals with similar disease risk profiles, and 3) a breakdown of the customer's ancestry. Cohorts are challenged to take steps to reduce their specific risk (e.g., heart disease, asthma, diabetes) and to share information about the efficacy of drug and non-drug treatment regimens. A game-based approach and peer encouragement will improve the customer's chances of successfully maintaining good habits to reduce their risk within their cohort. There are two premium subscription services: 1) an advanced genetic analysis based on genetic data and health information from family members with detailed strategies for reducing health risks and potential treatments, and 2) a genetic matchmaking service between members aimed at maximizing emotional compatibility and minimizing potential health risks to possible offspring.

The Market

Falling costs and greater consumer awareness of DNA sequencing is leading to an upcoming explosion in personal genomics data which will rapidly expand the market for genetic analysis. ValuedMe will target two customer segments of the growing personal genomics market: 20-35 year olds and 36-60 year olds. ValuedMe's services must appear fun and personalized in order to be popular with the younger age group and also appear trustworthy and relevant for the older age group. Targeting two distinct large groups with the same technology platform allows ValuedMe to achieve economies of scale earlier and capitalize sooner on the growth opportunities in the market.

Objectives

Become the premier provider of genetic health counseling and matchmaking services in the USA. Provide free and premium products that meet and anticipate our customers' needs. Improve the accuracy of our personal health risk, ancestry analysis, matchmaking and offspring health risk predictions by computational methods and by leveraging the detailed health information collected over time. Ensure sustainable profits through developing subscription-based premium products. Increase loyalty by strengthening user identification with their cohort community.

Keys to Success

There are three keys to success: 1) the website and mobile application must immediately capture the customer's attention and ultimately win their loyalty, 2) the predictions must be based on the most up-to-date scientific research, and 3) ValuedMe must develop a research engine that integrates genetic data with health, personality and behavioral data to discover new genetic factors and deliver this to customers effectively. The website and mobile application will be designed to facilitate easy input of the customer's cohort-related activities and integrate with popular social networking tools. They will also be used to invite customers to participate in surveys on different aspects of their health, well-being and personality. All participants will receive a detailed report of the results of each survey.

Sales

Revenue will initially come solely from sales of the two premium subscription products: advanced genetic analysis and genetic matchmaking. Additional revenue is expected from advertising sales as the website and mobile application usage increases and the user communities expand.

Mission

ValuedMe provides free services which rival or surpass comparable paid services available in the market and enable customers to help each other to live happier, healthier lives. ValuedMe also provides reasonably priced premium services with outstanding customer service and highly predictive personal health, matchmaking and offspring health risk assessments.

COVER LETTER

Dear Ms. Son,

I am responding to your advertisement for the position of Bioinformatics Specialist. I heard about the position from Hugh Wang of Kyowa Hakko Kirin. I believe the position may be a good fit for my experience and capabilities and am hoping you could tell me more about it.

Regarding my work experience, I have five years of bioinformatics software programming experience in both academic or industrial settings focusing on genomics, NextGen sequencing, software development and testing and cloud workflows (please see my attached resume). During my post-doctoral training, I worked for three years creating and validating NextGen sequencing pipelines.

My pipeline experience may be particularly interesting since LAIA is looking to expand on developing reusable pipelines. I created Agua (www.aguadev.org), an open-source bioinformatics cloud platform as a pipeline resource for the global research community. Agua is an end-to-end solution which allows researchers to easily accomplish NextGen analysis from sequencing to analysis and visualization using an intuitive web interface. I remain committed to expanding the use of standardized, reusable pipelines in the life-sciences and I have developed strategies and software to handle terabyte-sized datasets and public databases in automated local and cloud workflows.
    
I am an experienced Linux systems administrator and practice object-oriented, Agile, behavior-driven software development. I am proficient in Perl, Python, R, Matlab, Java, C/C++ and several other languages. I am intimately familiar with every stage of the software development life cycle and proficient in project management techniques.

My years of experience help me add value and be an effective team player. I have successfully led teams of up to four people and enjoy motivating and assisting others to meet shared goals. My role has often been to educate researchers about the possibilities and limitations of bioinformatics tools and techniques in diverse domains such as microarrays, sequence annotation, image analysis, mass spectrometry and EST databases. I am familiar with the major life sciences databases and enjoy the challenge of with dealing with a wide range of data types. I believe integrating data types from genetic to clinical is becoming the next big challenge for the life sciences in general and immunology in particular, and I am very interested in contributing to this effort. My PhD coursework included in-depth statistical inference and I have a solid understanding of statistics for biology through practical application in research.

To summarize my educational background, I have a PhD in Bioinformatics, MS in Bioinformatics, BSc in Biological Sciences and an MBA in Technology Management. During my PhD I achieved the following:

- Developed novel machine learning techniques for genomic annotation and metagenomic annotation
- Created a generic EST database platform for leveraging existing annotation databases while mitigating their inherent limitations
- Designed large-scale sequence assembly and annotation pipelines
- Assembled, installed, configured and maintained a 32-node HPC cluster using Sun Grid Engine (SGE) as the job scheduler

After my PhD, my three-year post-doctoral training consisted of the following:

- Analyzed TeraByte-scale data sets using a variety of computational techniques, software languages and high performance computing clusters (PBS/SGE/LSF) of 1000+ nodes
- Created the University of Miami's first NextGen analysis pipelines, including expression and DNA analysis workflows, SNP prediction, quality control and visualization tools
- Worked with diverse teams of researchers to successfully devise and execute software development plans to ensure the reliability and credibility of analysis results

Thank you for taking the time to read this message. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely, 

Stuart Young

BIOINFORMATICS SPECIALIST
There is an immediate opening for a Bioinformatics Specialist in the new Bioinformatics Core Facility at the La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology.  The position involves taking on both short- and long-term projects and contributing to various projects of researchers throughout the Institute.  Many of the projects deal directly with the analysis of sequence data produced by one of the 5 next-generation sequencers in our Sequencing Core Facility.  However, projects can involve data from a multitude of sources, including: microarrays, ELISAs, ELISPOTs, mass spectrometry, etc.  Requests may also include educating and empowering researchers to perform analyses on their own.  The candidate should therefore be comfortable with dealing with a variety of data types, be familiar with standard bioinformatics practices and databases, and have a solid understanding of statistics for biology.  As many of the requests will have similar workflows, we have begun to develop reusable analysis pipelines and would like to expand on this effort.

The successful candidate must be able to thrive in a fast-paced environment, juggle multiple projects, understand priorities, and complete all tasks in a timely manner.  Excellent communication skills are a must as the position involves constant interaction with non-bioinformatics staff. 

Education and experience:

Masters or Ph.D. in Bioinformatics or related field
2 or more years of experience in related position desired
Skills:

Familiarity with standard bioinformatics practices and databases
Experience with next-generation sequencing datasets and tools
Programming experience in at least two of the following languages: Perl, Python, Java, C/C++, R
Experience using a HPC
Familiar with programming best practices (e.g., revision control and testing)
Ability to consistently meet deadlines
Ability to prioritize projects
To apply, send CVs to careers@liai.org

NO /etc/X11/xorg.conf FILE IS PRESENT BECAUSE IT'S SUPERFLUOUS:

http://superuser.com/questions/51248/where-is-the-xorg-conf-file-in-karmic-koala-ubuntu-9-10

xorg.conf will not be present unless it is explicitly required.

The new X server doesn't need an xorg.conf file anymore rather gathering the
devices with dbus and may be installed without it on Jaunty. You can still b
uild your own though if you need to add something.


REASONS WHY IT'S NOT NEEDED NORMALLY:

Wikipedia on xorg.conf:

For a long time, editing xorg.conf was necessary for advanced input devices and multiple monitor output to
work correctly. This was regarded to be a major usability obstacle. In modern systems this is seldom necessary,
thanks to input hotplugging and the XRandR extension integrated into new X.org releases. It is still needed
for devices from some manufacturers, notably NVIDIA and Wacom, whose drivers fail to provide support for
those technologies.


CONFIRMED IT'S NOT PRESENT ON SYSTEM:

locate xorg.conf

/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf

This guide is for installing the NVIDIA closed source binary/restricted drivers on a system running an NVIDIA graphics card. For other graphics cards refer to the BinaryDriverHowto.

The NVIDIA provided driver supports hardware-accelerated 3D, TV-Out support, and dual-head functions.

Driver Versions
There are the following restricted driver versions available in the repositories. You may install the nvidia-current package for the driver of the current version.

96.43.18 (driver is 96.43.19 in the proposed updates source in ubuntu 10.10 )
173.14.28
185.18.36
195.36.24
To enable the latest version of binary driver in nvidia-current, please follow this link http://www.webupd8.org/2010/06/how-to-install-nvidia-25635-display.html to upgrade using a PPA repository.

Installation
Recommended step for Ubuntu 10.10
Version 96.43.18 is broken ,Go to System->Administration->Software sources then go to the update's tab--tick proposed update sources--close & refesh. please follow this link for more infomantion http://ubuntulifeblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/update-on-nvidia-96-driver-with-ubuntu.html

Recommended step for Ubuntu 10.04 or higher
Nouveau, an open source driver, is installed by default. You can remove it by command-line by entering this:

sudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau
Ubuntu 9.10 or higher
Go to System->Administration->Hardware Drivers and check the box to enable the restricted drivers for your NVIDIA card if the option is provided.
Note that in Ubuntu 10.10, Hardware Drivers is renamed to Additional Drivers.
If the restricted driver remains unactivated after attempting to activate it in the Hardware Drivers dialog, you may not have the appropriate linux headers installed to compile the driver. Ensure that the linux-headers-XXX and linux-restricted-modules-XXX packages are installed, where XXX matches the version of the kernel you are using (linux-image-XXX).
If the activation hangs on download/install dialog, you can install the driver using System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager, make sure you pick the latest driver version recommended by the "Hardware Drivers" tool and all its dependencies. Go to Hardware Drivers tool and activate the driver you just installed.
Once downloaded & installed, reboot your computer.
In 10.04, running sudo nvidia-xconfig on the command-line may be necessary before the driver module will function.
The Hardware Drivers tool may not work properly on machines that have previously used third party tools like 'Envy' or manual installation to install previous drivers. You should remove those drivers before attempting to install using the built-in tool.
Common Issues
Boot up splash screen issues for users of Ubuntu 10.04 & higher
Open up a Ternimal and install the Startup-Manager
                                                         sudo apt-get install startupmanager 
Launch the Startup Manager from "System>-Administration->Startup-Manager"
In the "Boot options" tab, change the resolution to something your monitor can handle (1024x768 is usually enough for the boot screen to look nice).
Change the color depth to "24 bits" and Press the "Close" button.Followed by a reboot to check that it is fixed.
Can't Save Settings
Nvidia-settings can't write to Xorg.conf if it hasn't been started with sudo.

Work round one:

Right click on your Desktop
Choose create launcher
The name is: nvidia-settings
The command is: gksudo nvidia-settings
Work round two:

Use the Monitors preferences (System->Preferences->Monitors)
Work round three:

Right click on your menu
Choose edit menus
Find System->Administration->NVIDIA X Server Settings
Click on properties
Change the command to gksudo /usr/bin/nvidia-settings
Suspend/Hibernation
If you have an old legacy NVIDIA card (eg driver 96.43.17), hibernation & suspend will not work. To fix it see NvidiaLaptopBinaryDriverSuspend.

Low Screen Resolutions
Often screen resolutions on offer are far lower than those offered with the open source driver. The NVIDIA binary driver seems to be very weak at reliably probing this information from the monitor and relies on additional information in xorg.conf.

To fix this you can add more resolutions by entering xrandr --addmode S-video ... in a command-line (where the dots add the resolution you want). For further details and potential workarounds see Fix X Resolution.

Workaround for 10.10
All these methods previously mentioned do not seem to always work. The following workaround worked for me.

The easiest way to install binary drivers is to use the built in Hardware Drivers manager in Ubuntu. In Ubuntu 10.04 and 9:10 this is found under System->Administration->Hardware Drivers. In Ubuntu 10:10 Hardware Drivers is now named additional Drivers
Select a nvidia hardware driver (see above which one too pick) and click Activate. The driver is now being downloaded and installed.
See NvidiaResolutionXorgConf
Screen Blanks/Monitor Turns Off
Using a laptop with a GeForce Go card, or connecting the sole display via DVI on a dual-head system sometimes results in the screen not receiving a picture. This is caused by the driver outputting video to the VGA port on the graphics card, instead of DVI.

The usual hint that you have this problem is when you hear the startup sound but nothing appears on the screen. If you do not hear any sound, you are more than likely experiencing unrelated problems.

This is a launchpad bug about displays on digital outputs being blank when using NVIDIA binary driver, and can be resolved by editing your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file:

Switch to the console (Try using ctrl+alt+F1, or reboot and select recovery mode from the GRUB menu.)
Use your text editor to open /etc/X11/xorg.conf (try sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf).
Find the line that says Section "Screen"
Insert a new line that says Option "UseDisplayDevice" "DFP".
Save the file. If you had to restart into recovery mode, type reboot, otherwise restart your display using sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart.
Incorrect Refresh Rate Reported
If you are using nvidia-glx/nvidia-glx-new and the refresh rate appears wrong (or different to that actually reported by your monitor) in gnome-display-properties/xrandr, you are probably seeing the effects of the DynamicTwinView feature. See this launchpad bug about being unable to "set" a proper screen refresh rate for details of this behaviour.

Problems with Video Playback
If you have problems with video playback, e.g. in mplayer, gxine, or mythtv frontend with a legacy card, it may be due to too high a color depth (e.g. using NT6 Vanta/Vanta LT "nvidia" driver, I experienced flickering vertical bars & blue screen flashing). To fix this, manually edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change DefaultDepth to 16.

nvidia-settings [options]

  -v, --version
      Print the nvidia-settings version and exit.

  -h, --help
      Print usage information and exit.

  --config=[CONFIG]
      Use the configuration file CONFIG rather than the default ~/.nvidia-settings-rc

  -c, --ctrl-display=[CTRL-DISPLAY]
      Control the specified X display.  If this option is not given, then nvidia-settings will control the display specified by '--display'; if that is not given, then the $DISPLAY environment
      variable is used.

  -l, --load-config-only
      Load the configuration file, send the values specified therein to the X server, and exit.  This mode of operation is useful to place in your xinitrc file, for example.

  -n, --no-config
      Do not load the configuration file.  This mode of operation is useful if nvidia-settings has difficulties starting due to problems with applying settings in the configuration file.

  -r, --rewrite-config-file
      Write the X server configuration to the configuration file, and exit, without starting the graphical user interface.  See EXAMPLES section.

  -V, --verbose=[VERBOSE]
      Controls how much information is printed.  By default, the verbosity is errors and only error messages are printed.  Valid values are 'errors' (print error messages), 'warnings' (print error
      and warning messages), and 'all' (print error, warning and other informational messages).

  -a, --assign=[ASSIGN]
      The ASSIGN argument to the '--assign' command line option is of the form:
      
        {DISPLAY}/{attribute name}[{display devices}]={value}
      
      This assigns the attribute {attribute name} to the value {value} on the X Display {DISPLAY}.  {DISPLAY} follows the usual {host}:{display}.{screen} syntax of the DISPLAY environment variable
      and is optional; when it is not specified, then it is implied following the same rule as the --ctrl-display option.  If the X screen is not specified, then the assignment is made to all X
      screens.  Note that the '/' is only required when {DISPLAY} is present.
      
      {DISPLAY} can additionally include a target specification to direct an assignment to something other than an X screen.  A target specification is contained within brackets and consists of a
      target type name, a colon, and the target id.  The target type name can be one of "screen", "gpu", "framelock", "vcs", "gvi", or "fan"; the target id is the index into the list of targets
      (for that target type).  The target specification can be used in {DISPLAY} wherever an X screen can be used, following the syntax {host}:{display}[{target_type}:{target_id}].  See the output
      of
      
        nvidia-settings -q all 
      
      for information on which target types can be used with which attributes.  See the output of
      
         nvidia-settings -q screens -q gpus -q framelocks -q vcs -q gvis -q fans 
      
      for lists of targets for each target type.
      
      The [{display devices}] portion is also optional; if it is not specified, then the attribute is assigned to all display devices.
      
      Some examples:
      
        -a FSAA=5
        -a localhost:0.0/DigitalVibrance[CRT-0]=0
        --assign="SyncToVBlank=1"
        -a [gpu:0]/DigitalVibrance[DFP-1]=63

  -q, --query=[QUERY]
      The QUERY argument to the '--query' command line option is of the form:
      
        {DISPLAY}/{attribute name}[{display devices}]
      
      This queries the current value of the attribute {attribute name} on the X Display {DISPLAY}.  The syntax is the same as that for the '--assign' option, without '={value}'; specify '-q
      screens', '-q gpus', '-q framelocks', '-q vcs', '-q gvis', or '-q fans' to query a list of X screens, GPUs, Frame Lock devices, Visual Computing Systems, SDI Input Devices, or Fans,
      respectively, that are present on the X Display {DISPLAY}.  Specify '-q all' to query all attributes.

  -t, --terse
      When querying attribute values with the '--query' command line option, only print the current value, rather than the more verbose description of the attribute, its valid values, and its
      current value.

  -d, --display-device-string
      When printing attribute values in response to the '--query' option, if the attribute value is a display device mask, print the value as a list of display devices (e.g., "CRT-0, DFP-0"),
      rather than a hexadecimal bit mask (e.g., 0x00010001).

  -g, --glxinfo
      Print GLX Information for the X display and exit.

  -e, --describe=[DESCRIBE]
      Prints information about a particular attribute.  Specify 'all' to list the descriptions of all attributes.  Specify 'list' to list the attribute names without a descriptions.

#This file is configured to allow Kensington Displaylink adapter to function as a second
#display screen, if attached.  If not attached this file works with the Nvidia chip
#and loads the Nvidia proprietary driver allowing the full resolution of 1920x1200.  
#
#I couldn't get the IOGear Displaylink device working, even by itself.  That may be due to 
#a different, earlier chip.  I may need to get a more recent Displaylink adapter to have 3 monitors.
#It took much to get this working.  Here's what I think is necessary to make the Kensington 
#adapter work. 
#
#Download and install a 2.6.34 kernel as it has updated udlfb, the kernel Displaylink
#framebuffer driver.  Kernel packages can be found at http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
#but that only seems to have generic kernels.  To fully utilize more the about 3.5Gb
#of memory you need PAE (Physical Address Extension).  Generic kernels aren't compiled
#to use PAE, only special PAE or server kernels are.  It appears a PAE version
#is available here http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/packages/show/203551.  This Xorg file was
#tested to work on the generic kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.34-lucid/.
#
#Install the package xserver-xorg-video-displaylink which is the X driver for DisplayLink devices.
#This recently was called xf86-driver-displaylink but the new package has the latest version.
#
#To get a starting /etc/X11/xorg.conf connect each monitor to a graphics output on the Nvidia chip
#on the Zotac board and execute nvidia-xconfig.  This will create a new xorg.conf if one doesn't
#already exist.  Save the xorg.conf for each monitor.  
#
#Use the info in xorg.conf file for each monitor to create a combined xorg.conf. Then update the Device 
#for Displaylink adapter to have Driver "displaylink" and Option "fbdev" "/dev/fb0".  Also update
#Identifier strings for the DisplayLink adapter to "Device1", "Screen1", "Monitor1".
#
#There are issues with the Nvidia driver for the Nvidia chip on the Zotac board and the 
#Displaylink driver.  The Displaylink driver will be unloaded if the Nvidia device is Screen 0 in the 
#ServerLayout Section.  The workaround is to make the Displaylink Screen 0.  The
#consequence of the workaround is the that Nvidia is not recognized to use the Nvidia 
#proprietary driver. This limits the Nvidia screen resolution to 1680x1050 and none of the monitor 
#GUI monitor tools work.
#
#Additionally color depth for the Nvidia device must be set at 16 to match the maximum of the 
#Displaylink device.  Note that this setting limits the Nvidia to 16 even when the Displaylink
#device is not attached.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Libraries have been installed in:
       /usr/local/lib
    
    If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
    in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
    specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
    flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
       - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
         during execution
       - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
         during linking
       - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
       - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'
    
    See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
    more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

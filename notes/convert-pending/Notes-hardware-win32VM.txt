Hi Daniel,

Still no luck. I keep getting the same error:

“The local policy of this system does not allow you to log on interactively.”

Cheers,

Stuart.

Stuart,

I’m going to reboot the virtual to see if it clears up the issue. Please hold.

Mr. Young,

We are having some difficulties with our VM environment today. That is why you cannot reach your 
VM.

Hi Daniel,

I can’t access ‘MEDSEQMANNGEN01’ using Windows Remote Desktop.

When I try to connect, I get the following error:

       The remote connection has timed out. Please try connecting to the remote computer again.

Cheers,

Stuart.

Mr. Young,

Your Win XP 32 Bit VM has been created. It has been named MEDSEQMANNGEN01. You should be 
able to remote into the machine and install your application. Also, so that I can setup the TSM Backup 
Client, please let me know what directories should be backed up on a nightly basis.

Regards,

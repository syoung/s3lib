--------------------------------------------------------
1. System Requirements

1.1 Perl
The InterProScan package has been developed in Perl5 under UNIX and requires that various 
perl modules be installed beforehand.  Please note that all these modules are available via the 
CPAN website (http://search.cpan.org/)
  * DB_File.pm - the interface to Berkeley DB, which is a part of the standard Perl5 distribution. 
  * XML::Parser.pm - libexpat (1.95.5 or newer) which is needed for the new implementation of 
    BlastProDom and to parse xml outputs.
  * XML::Quote
  * English
  * File::Basename
  * File::Copy
  * File::Path
  * File::Spec::Functions
  * Sys::Hostname
  * Mail::Send
  * FileHandle
  * IO::Scalar
  * CGI
  * URI::Escape
  * IO::String

1.2 Operating Systems
Binaries of signature recognition methods are provided for the following UNIX platforms:
  * SGI (iprscan_bin_IRIX64.tar.gz)
  * Mac Darwin 10.2 or newer (iprscan_bin_Darwin-10.2.tar.gz)
  * Linux PC (iprscan_bin_Linux.tar.gz)
  * DEC Alpha (iprscan_bin_OSF1.tar.gz)
  * Solaris/Sparc (iprscan_bin_SunOS.tar.gz)
  * AIX 6.5 (iprscan_bin_AIX6.5.tar.gz)

We do not support running InterProScan on any other platform, including Windows.

For distributed computing:
  * InterProScan relies on UNIX rsh. This means you have to be able to rlogin to the hosts you 
    are going to use.
  * The installation should be on a shared file system (e.g. over NFS) that is accessible from all 
    hosts (in the queue) you are going to use.
  * The installation step implies that you are able to execute such commands as 'ls', 'pwd', 'rsh' 
    and 'uname'.

1.3 Disk Space
The full installation (with binaries & data for all platforms) takes about 9 Gb.


2. Software Install

2.1 File Download
Download the following files from ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/interpro/iprscan :

 * RELEASE/latest/iprscan_v4.x.tar.gz  - InterProScan itself
 * BIN/4.x/iprscan_bin4.x_[PLATFORM].tar.gz - Binaries for the various platforms
 * DATA/iprscan_DATA_[LATESTDATAVERSION].tar.gz - databases used by InterProScan (except Panther)
 * DATA/iprscan_PTHR_DATA_[LATESTDATAVERSION].tar.gz - panther database and indexes

Where [PLATFORM] is your Operating System and [LATESTDATAVERSION] is the most recent 
version of the data available on the FTP site. The binaries in the BIN directory have been pre-
compiled for each platform for your convenience. If you to compile them yourself with your own
options, see the README file for url(s) where to download them from.

2.2 File decompression
Decompress each of them in the root directory where you want to install InterProScan.  When 
unpacked, the files contain a sub-directory structure and so you should unpack them all from the 
same place.

  % gunzip -c iprscan_DATA_[LATEST_VERSION].tar.gz | tar -xvf -
  % gunzip -c iprscan_PTHR_DATA_[LATESTDATAVERSION].tar.gz | tar -xvf -
  % gunzip -c iprscan_bin4.x_[PLATFORM].tar.gz | tar -xvf -
  % gunzip -c iprscan_v4.x.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

The following directory structure will be created:

./iprscan/
	|-bin   = contains perl scripts and binaries for InterProScan
	|  `-binaries/
	|-conf  = contains configuration files for setting up InterProScan locally
	|-data  = contains all member databases (e.g. Pfam)
	|-docs  = contains documentation
	|-image = contains images used in the graphical output and web GUI
	|-lib   = contains additional perl modules and scripts for running InterProScan
	`-tmp   = storage area for temporary files created 

2.3 Log into the machine
If you will be running InterProScan via a queue system (such as LSF), you must make sure that 
you are logged into the machine with the queue software installed and available before running 
the installation script.

2.4 Find out perl path
Find out what the full path of the perl installation you will be using is.

  % which perl

2.5 Run Config.pl
Change into the iprscan directory and run the Config.pl script to start the installation process.  
Answer the prompts or press <Enter> to accept the defaults:

  % cd iprscan
  % /<path>/<to>/<your>/perl Config.pl


You will be asked the following questions (there is additional useful information about what you are
configuring written below; not everything will be displayed on screen):

 If you are updating an old installation, you can keep some of the configuration information from 
 the previous install.  If you wish to do a completely fresh install, answer "y" to this.

  Reconfigure everything (first time install)? (y|n)

 InterProScan needs to know where it is installed.  If you do not provide this, the installation root 
 will be the home directory of the user ($HOME in the environment) by default or otherwise, the 
 current working directory.  If you do decide to set paths, you will be prompted for the full path of 
 InterProScan on your system. Likewise, by default, the installation script will take the default 
 perl path (found by running which perl) unless you specify otherwise.

  Do you want to set paths? (y|n): 
  Enter the full path for the InterProScan installation?:
  Do you want to set another one Perl command in place of [default_PERL]? (y|n):

 To cope with bulk jobs and to enable efficient parallelisation, InterProScan splits input files with 
 FASTA formatted sequences into smaller parts (chunks). The default size suggested is "10".  The 
 value you provide is the number of sequences that will be put into each chunk.  If you put a higher 
 value, you will have fewer chunks, with more sequences in each chunk and vice versa.  Try to 
 avoid using a value that would give you more than 3000 chunks.  If you are having speed 
 problems, you may wish to try altering this value first.

  Setup chunk size? (y|n)
  Enter chunk size (default 10):

 You can configure InterProScan to limit the number of input sequences (protein & nucleotide) and 
 the maximum length for a nucleotide sequence and minimum length for a protein sequence. You 
 can also configure the minimum length for a translated ORF and which codon table value
 to use to translate DNA/RNA sequence into six frames (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-
 bin/mutations/trtables.cgi ). If you wish to configure this behaviour, answer "y" to the question.  
 Otherwise, the defaults shown in brackets will be used.

  Do you want to configure it? (y|n)
  Enter the maximum of input protein sequences (default = 1000):
  Enter the maximum of input nucleic sequences (default = 100):
  Enter the maximum length (nucleic acids) for a nucleotide sequence (default = 10000):
  Enter the minimum length (amino acids) for a protein sequence (default = 5):
  Enter the minimum length for the length of a translated orf (default = 50):
  Enter the default codon table value to use to translate dna/rna in six frames (default = 0):

 Next you will be asked which applications (such as Pfam, Panther, Gene3D, etc.) you wish to use 
 in InterProScan.  Please note that certain databases and/or algorithms are only available with a 
 license.  Please see the README for more information about where to obtain the various 
 binaries.  You will also be asked whether you wish to use a queue system, such as Sun 
 GridEngine, PBS or LSF.  If you do not have a queue system, the jobs will be run locally (see the 
 README for more information on queue systems).

  Do you want to setup applications (if you don't, no applications will be included in InterProScan by default)?(y/n)
  Do you wish to use a queue system? (y|n)

 If you answer "y" to the second question, you will then be asked which of the supported queue 
 systems you wish to use (Hit enter for the ones you don't wish to use and "y" for the one you do): 

  Do you want to use sge6/lsf42/pbs (y|n)

 You can then specify global settings for the queue system, such as a global cluster name and/or 
 queue name.  If you say you do wish to specify the system settings, you will be prompted for 
 them.

  Do you want to set a global cluster name for all applications? (Default = 'n') (y|n):
  Please enter the global cluster name you want to use for all applications:
  Do you want to set a global queue name for all applications? (Default = 'n') (y|n):
  Please enter the name of the global queue you want to use for all applications:

 You are then shown the information you entered and asked to confirm that it is correct

  Is all this information correct? (y|n)

 Next, you can specify which tools you wish to use within InterProScan and, if you are using a 
 queue system with multiple queues, which cluster and/or queue to run them on.  Remember that 
 certain tools (TMHMM, SignalP and Superfamily) require a license.  At this point, Config.pl will 
 also check that your operating system is supported and print an error if it isn't.

  Do you want to use [TOOL_NAME] (y|n)		
  Which queueing system?(lsf42|pbs54|sge|condor)
  Do you want to launch [TOOL_NAME] on a specific cluster? (y|n)
  Enter cluster name:
  Do you want to execute [TOOL_NAME] on a specific queue ? (y|n):
  Enter the queue name to run [TOOL_NAME] using resource:

 If you answered that you DON'T wish to use a queuing system, you can look at the supported 
 queue systems again by answering yes when asked.  Otherwise, by default 'local' will by set for 
 all your applications. If you want to set a queueing system to be run with your applications later, 
 you can relaunch Config.pl.  If you want to run the tools without a queue system but on a different 
 host than the one you are logged into (via rsh) you can specify it in the next section.

  Please enter the execution host name of [TOOL_NAME]:

 In version 4.1, taxonomy filtering was introduced, where you can filter your results according to 
 the taxonomy in the InterPro entry.

  Do you want to make it available for users? (y|n)

 Next, you set up the administrator email address.  If there is a problem with the installation, email 
 will be sent to you and a mail link placed on the web interface if you choose to install it.

  Do you want to set an administrator email address? (y|n)
  Please enter the email address of the administrator:

 The Config.pl script will now go through all the files necessary and configure them according to 
 your wishes.

 You can set up InterProScan to run via a web interface.  You will need to have access to a web 
 server in order to do this.  You can download the open-source Apache web server for UNIX from 
 http://httpd.apache.org/.  If you do decide to install the web interface, you will need to edit the 
 httpd.conf files with the information that is printed out by Config.pl and restart the web server.

  Do you want to run InterProScan using a web interface? (y|n)
  Do you want to run InterProScan through a secure HTTP server? (y|n)
  Enter the name of your server name. You can specify a specific port to listen to. (e.g. foo.bar.com:4000)?: 

 Config.pl will now try to index the data files you have downloaded for use with InterProScan.  If 
 there is a problem, it will be output to the screen. Please note, this may take a long time.

 Finally, you will be asked if you wish to register InterProScan.  This is so that we can better 
 understand the type of users who download the software.  It also adds you to a (quiet) mailing list, 
 where announcements on releases and bug fixes are made.

  Proceed with the registration (y|n)
  Your organization name:
  Contact person:
  Contact e-mail:
  WEB interface?

 If the installation is completed successfully, you will see the following message:

  Installation is completed


2.6 Test the installation
You can test that the installation has worked properly by running the provided set of test 
sequences thus:

  % cd bin; ./iprscan -cli -i ../test.seq -iprlookup -goterms

-iprlookup requests that InterProScan looks up the corresponding InterPro entry and 
-goterms does the same in GO (Gene Ontology). -cli specifies that the script is being run on 
the command line and not via the web (CGI).  For a full range of options on the command-line, 
type the following:

  % ./iprscan -cli -h

You can compare your results with the merged.raw files provided.
merged.raw.crc is the results file when a crc check is done for pre-computed
results in the match file.  merged.raw.nocrc is from when -nocrc is specified
on the command-line and so results look-up is not performed and all methods
are run again on the sequences.

3. Data Update

The InterPro database currently updates on a semi-regular basis (approximately every 2-3 
months).  When this happens, the data for InterProScan will also update on the FTP site.  In order 
to ensure that you have the correct results, you should check you have the latest version of the 
data installed.  To update the data, do the following:

Download the latest release tar.gz files from ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/interpro/iprscan/DATA/

Go to the directory that contains your iprscan installation directory. Untar and unzip the files:

  % gunzip -c /<path>/<to>/iprscan_DATA_[LATESTDATAVERSION].tar.gz | tar -xvf -
  % gunzip -c /<path>/<to>/iprscan_PTHR_DATA_[LATESTDATAVERSION].tar.gz | tar -xvf -

Check that the indices are up-to-date by running bin/index_data.pl, if they aren't, run 
bin/index_data.pl with the -inx and -bin options. (For more help on index_data.pl run with the -h 
option).

Alternatively, you can download the individual files, placing them in the ./iprscan/data directory 
(e.g. interpro.xml, match.xml, Pfam, sf_hmm, sf_hmm_sub, smart.HMMs, Gene3D.hmm, 
smart.desc (not public), smart.thresholds (not public), superfamily.hmm, TIGRFAMs_HMM.LIB or 
prodom.ipr).  Ensure that you re-index them using index_data.pl as before.
Please note that InterProScan now assumes that HMM files will be converted to
binary format before searching, for speed.

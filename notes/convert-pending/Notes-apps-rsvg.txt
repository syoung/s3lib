LOOKING FOR 'pangocairo.pc' USING pkg-config AS BELOW:

>>>
Pango is definitely installed. pango.pc exists in /usr/lib/pkgconfig/

--
[root@server1 ~]# pkg-config --cflags pango
-I/usr/include/pango-1.0 -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/ 
include
--

Looking at the configure file, I see that it's trying to look for a  
package called "pangocairo". The line in the configure file shows:
PANGO_PACKAGES="pango pangocairo"

When I run pkg-config to search for 'pangocairo', it's not found.

I've gone back to the installation of Pango and found that  
pangocairo.pc is in the build directory. It's all there but for some  
reason, make install of Pango doesn't copy pangocairo.pc or any of  
the pangocairo files into the respective installation directories.

I've tried to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the build directory of  
pango, which forces gtk+ to configure but when it comes to build  
time, it fails.

TRIED pango 1.2.0, DOWNLOADED FROM:

www.pango.org

BUT WOULD NOT MAKE.

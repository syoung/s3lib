<entry [Sun Nov 22 21:19:03 UTC 2009] FIXED MISSING RICH TEXT EDITOR>






***  SUPPORT REQUEST ***



CHECKED IN GENERAL CONFIGS BUT RICH TEXT WAS ENABLED

There is a current issue open for the bundled plugins found at:
http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-7750

CAUSE:
In Confluence 2.5 the "Tiny MCE" (Rich Text Editor) was moved to a plugin format as part of the bundled-plugins. It existed as included javascript in previous versions. This will cause an issue for users who cannot extract the bundled-plugins with confluence.

WORKAROUND:
Manually extract the 'atlassian-tinymce-plugin-1.12.jar' from 'atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip' and upload it using the Plugin Repository interface. No reboot of apache required; Rich Text Editor begins working right away.


I solved it by just unzipping the plugins file manually and putting the .jar
files into the {CONFLUENCE_DATA_DIR}/bundled_plugins directory.

The plugins are in the file:
WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup/atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip

cd /usr/share/confluence/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup/


THAT CAN'T BE IT AS THE UNZIPPED atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip FILE CONTAINS IDENTICAL FILES TO THOSE CONTAINED IN THE <CONFLUENCE-DATA>/bundled_plugins FOLDER:

diff /usr/share/confluence-data/bundled-plugins /usr/share/confluence/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup

Running Confluence on a VM can be very tricky, and not recommended by Atlassian...

That said, sometimes there are crazy corporate policies...

Had a client with the same problem you are having. It turned out to be something related to the memory allocated to that virtual machine... because the confluence server was not too busy, its memory was being borrowed for other VMs by the VM Server... I think there is a way of setting the VM's memory not to be shared...

Something similar could be set for disk space.

Another creative solution would be putting a wget on a cron job, to access a given page every few minutes so the VM Server does not take the memory away...





I think I may have found the source of the problem: Generating JSESSIONID takes a long time. I have made the following change to server.xml:

<Manager randomClass="java.security.SecureRandom" pathname="" />

And the problem has not appeared since. Why this problem appears on a VM and not on a physical XP install I do not know, but I will investigate further.

<entry [Sat Nov 21 14:33:03 UTC 2009] INSTALL LAMP ON kbcspta LINODE>




SET TIMEZONE

By default, Linode installations of CentOS are set to Eastern Standard Time.


INSTALL APACHE

yum install httpd

The configuration for Apache is contained in the httpd.conf file, which is located at: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. We advise you to make a backup of this file into your home directory, like so:

cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf ~/httpd.conf.backup


SET SECURITY

A configuration tool is available for basic firewall administration. Install the tool by issuing the following command:

yum install system-config-securitylevel-tui

Then, use the following command to start the tool:

system-config-securitylevel-tui

If you need more control over the firewall, you can interact with the firewall (iptables) directly with the iptables command, and you can see an output of all iptables rules with the following command:

less /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config


INSTALL whois (i.e., jwhois)

yum install jwhois


SET VIRTUAL HOST FOR kbcspta.org

yum install emacs



START HTTPD

/etc/init.d/httpd start


ADD TO .bash_profile

alias apache='su -s /bin/bash apache'
alias gobash='emacs -nw ~/.bash_profile'
alias sobash='source ~/.bash_profile'
alias em='emacs -nw'



WORKING!


TRANSFER DOMAIN www.kbcspta.com TO LINODE


LOGIN TO godaddy.com:

user: kbcspta



BEFORE TRANSFER IS EFFECTIVE USE THE helpinghost DNS SERVERS

Primary DNS server:               ns1.helpinghost.com
Primary DNS IP address:       64.246.27.246
Secondary DNS server:           ns2.helpinghost.com
Secondary DNS IP address:   207.44.192.32



CHANGE DNS SERVERS TO LINODE HERE

https://manage.opensrs.net/

(LOGIN AS HELPINGHOST USER)

IN 'Name servers' SET THESE ADDRESSES:

ns1.linode.com
ns2.linode.com
ns3.linode.com
ns4.linode.com

(Allow up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate through the Internet, although it may 
happen much faster. You can use the whois utility from a shell prompt to see if your domain's 
record has been updated with our nameservers.)



SET DOMAIN NAME ON LINODE:

SEE http://library.linode.com/linode-manager/configuring-dns-with-the-linode-manager:

Log into the Linode Manager and click the "DNS Manager" tab. You'll see an empty zone list.

Click "Add a new domain zone" and enter 'stuartpyoung.com', then click OK.

Enter the SOA email address (use administrative contact email address for your domain) and accept the default choices for the remaining options.

Several DNS records will be automatically created for your domain. These include a default entry for your domain, A records for "www" and "mail", and an MX record directing mail delivery to "mail.yourdomain.com".


SET THE DOMAIN'S REVERSE DNS:

LinodeManager --> Network tab --> reverse DNS (entry for your Linode's IP address):

NB: use the whole domain name, including the 'www':

www.stuartpyoung.com





INSTALL MySQL

yum install mysql-server

In CentOS 5.2 this provides version 5.0.45 of MySQL. 


SET MYSQL TO RUN ON BOOT

/sbin/chkconfig --levels 235 mysqld on

Use the chkconfig command to setup runlevels as needed.

Now you can start the mysql daemon (mysqld) with the following command (as root):

/etc/init.d/mysqld start


Initializing MySQL database:  WARNING: The host 'origin' could not be looked up with resolveip.
This probably means that your libc libraries are not 100 % compatible
with this binary MySQL version. The MySQL daemon, mysqld, should work
normally with the exception that host name resolving will not work.
This means that you should use IP addresses instead of hostnames
when specifying MySQL privileges !
Installing MySQL system tables...
OK
Filling help tables...
OK

To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h origin password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the manual for more instructions.

You can start the MySQL daemon with:
cd /usr ; /usr/bin/mysqld_safe &

You can test the MySQL daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd mysql-test ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

Please report any problems with the /usr/bin/mysqlbug script!

The latest information about MySQL is available on the web at
http://www.mysql.com
Support MySQL by buying support/licenses at http://shop.mysql.com
                                                                     [  OK  ]
Starting MySQL:                                                      [  OK  ]



INSTALL PHP 

yum install php5 php-pear


Once PHP5 is installed we'll need to tune the configuration file located in /etc/php.ini to enable more descriptive errors, logging, and better performance. These modifications provide a good starting point if you're unfamiliar with PHP configuration.

Make sure that the following values are set, and relevant lines are uncommented (comments are lines begining with a semi-colon (;)):

emacs /etc/php.ini

error_reporting = E_COMPILE_ERROR|E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR|E_ERROR|E_CORE_ERROR
display_errors = Off
log_errors = On
error_log = /var/log/php.log
max_execution_time = 300
memory_limit = 64M
register_globals = Off


INSTALL support for MySQL in PHP

yum install php-mysql


INSTALL mod_python

yum install mod_python


To enable python support for the site "kbcspta.org", you need to add the following to the site's <VirtualHost > entry in the configuration file:

emacs /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf

AddHandler mod_python .py
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
PythonDebug On

SO IT NOW READS:

<VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerAdmin admin@kbcspta.org
     ServerName kbcspta.org
     ServerAlias www.kbcspta.org
     DocumentRoot /srv/www/kbcspta.org/
     ErrorLog /srv/www/kbcspta.org/logs/error.log
     CustomLog /srv/www/kbcspta.org/logs/access.log combined

     AddHandler mod_python .py
     PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
     PythonDebug On

</VirtualHost>


AND RESTART APACHE

/etc/init.d/httpd reload 

Reloading httpd:                                                     [  OK  ]


INSTALL MYSQL SUPPORT FOR PYTHON

yum install MySQL-python

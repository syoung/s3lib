Notes-project36-solexa.rerun.txt

Bill, Stuart,

I’ve built the GAPipeline V1.3.2 software on kronos.  The path is /mihg/analysis/GAPipeline-1.3.2/bin.  The data folders are located under /mihg/data/2sort/solexa and from_solexa01. 

You should have read access to the data.  You can run tests using /nethome for output while we get the folders set up under /mihg/data/core.

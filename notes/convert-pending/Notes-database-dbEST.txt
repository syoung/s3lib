RE: [Batch-sub] Submission of Fundulus heteroclitus ESTs

Hi Jane,

Thanks for your followup message. I've recreated all of the original EST files with a different filtering algorithm that retains most of the original sequence (removes vector sequence and poly-A) and ensures that all sequences are greater than 10bp long (the vast majority are much longer). I hope they will pass your quality filters.

Would it be possible to use these to replace the Fundulus heteroclitus sequences that were submitted last week (i.e., expts 151, 152 and 153 of which you sent me the accession numbers)?

Please let me know if you need me to reformat the files (for expts 151, 152 and 153) from

STATUS:    New

to

STATUS:    Update


Please find attached to this email the following files:

    Dear Dr. Young,

    We have not had a response to our email of July 12.

    Will you be resubmitting the ESTs from libraries 154-159?

    Would it be agreeable if we remove the ESTs already entered which have less than 6
    nucleotides?

    Regards,

SJT: RE: Submission of Fundulus heteroclitus ESTs - FINAL FILE  ***RESEND***

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am resending the final file in the series of Fundulus heteroclitus ESTs. It appears it was too big to pass through the filters at your end so I've split it into 10 subfiles, each with the same publication, library and contact sections at the beginning of the file:

funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.1.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.2.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.3.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.4.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.5.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.6.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.7.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.8.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.9.txt
funnybase11.submitdbEST.e159.10.txt

Could you please let me know roughly how long it will be before you'll be sending me the accession numbers?

Thanks and best regards,

./configure --prefix=/nethome/syoung/apps/gcc/4.5.2

    configure: error: Building GCC requires GMP 4.2+, MPFR 2.3.1+ and MPC 0.8.0+.
    Try the --with-gmp, --with-mpfr and/or --with-mpc options to specify
    their locations.  Source code for these libraries can be found at
    their respective hosting sites as well as at
    ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/.  See also
    http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html for additional info.  If
    you obtained GMP, MPFR and/or MPC from a vendor distribution package,
    make sure that you have installed both the libraries and the header
    files.  They may be located in separate packages.

UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME

If this is the first time yo've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:

Check to make sure thany new hardware or software is properly installed.
 If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need.
 
 If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then select Safe Mode.
 
 Technical information:
 
 *** STOP: 0x000000ED (0x85F5C900,0xC0000032,0x00000000,0x00000000)
 
 
SOLUTION:
---------
When booting up to Win XP you may get a error that reads "Unmountable Boot Volume". This is probably because your boot.ini file is messed up.

So, what do you do about it, panic and try to mount your boot in your computer...... No that is probably not a good idea.

You can boot to the XP cd and when you see the Welcome to setup press the letter R
You will get a dos prompt
Then type "chkdsk /p" without the quotes and hit enter
When that is done type "fixboot" and hit enter
"Y" and enter at the prompt
Then type "exit" and hit enter
The system will now reboot into Windows

If for some reason that don't work for you, you can boot to the recovery console like above and...
Type "chkdsk /r" then enter
When done type "exit" and hit enter.
This will take longer, but the system should boot back into Windows.

COPY SECUREFX SESSION DATABASE

How do I move my SecureFX session database to a different machine?

The following steps describe how to migrate your SecureFX session database to another machine.
Note: These instructions are for SecureFX 3.0 and later.

Install SecureFX on the new machine.
Find the location of the session configuration folder on the old machine. To do this, start SecureFX, open the "Options" menu and select "Global Options...". Then select the "General" category. The configuration folder location will be displayed in the "Configuration folder" field.
Copy the configuration folder and its contents to the new machine.

Under Windows XP/2000, the default location is:
C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\VanDyke\SecureFX\Config

Under Windows Me/98/NT/95, the default location is:
C:\Program Files\SecureFX\Config
Run SecureFX on the new machine. If SecureFX does not find the session database, open the "Options" menu and select "Global Options". Then select the "General" category. Browse to the correct location of the configuration folder and save your settings. When you restart SecureFX, it should use the migrated session database.

REMOVE ANNOYING ZONE ALARM "New Network Found" MESSAGE

Zone Alarm problem

Q. I recently installed Zone Alarm on my computer. It seems now that almost every time I start my computer I get an alert notice from Zone Alarm advising a "New Network Found. ZoneAlarm has found a new connection between your computer and the Internet or another computer." Is this normal?

A. According to Zonelabs, the company that makes Zone Alarm, this is a common problem with certain versions of the Zone Alarm product. You need to make sure you are using the most current version of Zone Alarm. To do this, open up the program and look in the Status section. If you see a box that says "An update is available" you need to click on that and follow the instructions to download and install the update.

If you are running the latest version and you still have this problem then you have an issue with the Zone Alarm database on your computer and you will need to reset it.

To reset the database you will first need to boot your computer into safe mode and navigate to the folder:

C:\Windows\Internet Log 


Once you are in this folder, find and delete the files:

backup.rdb
iamdb.rdb


and reboot your computer normally.

Keep in mind that once you reset this database, Zone Alarm will lose all of its customizations and will have to be retrained for your Internet connection. This is the same process you went through when you first installed the program.

REMOVE 'File tasks and folders' PANE IN WINDOWS EXPLORER


Open up Explorer, go to Tools -> Folder Options. Under the "General" tab, "Tasks" --> "Use Windows classic folders".


I would also click on the "View" tab and click "Apply to All Folders" just to make sure it makes it to all the folders already cached.

There's a small chance that you might need to clear the existing stored folder settings, but I've never had to do that. Just in case, remove the two registry keys below. Or, paste all the lines below into Notepad, save it with a file extension ".reg" and double-click to have regedit delete the entries for you (Tip: tacking on a minus sign deletes the key; leaving it out creates the key).

HP nx9420 with docking station, dual externa monitors; how can laptop screen still display
Asked by TECHDLS in PC Laptops, Miscellaneous Hardware, Windows XP Operating System
Tags: hp, docking, station, dual, monitors
Hello
Using HP nx9420 laptop in an HP docking station that has both digital and analog monitor ports.  Attaching two external monitors works great with laptop closed.
When you open the laptop, you lostethe display on one of the external monitors; close the laptop, the two monitor display returns.
Is there a way to use the laptop screen as a third monitor without adding any third party devices?

If not, is that due to a limitation of XP Pro or the docking station?

If we need to purchase a third party device, it would need to connect to the docking station, either analog or digital.  Is that possible, and what do you recommend?

ANSWER:

It is nto a limitation of XP.... It is a hardware limitation....

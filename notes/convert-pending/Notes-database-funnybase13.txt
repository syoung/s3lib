CC: Doug, Margie, Tim
SJT: funnybase13 RESEQUENCED READS PIPELINE

Hi Jeff,

Here's the instructions on how to blast the resequenced reads (which you'll load 
into the 'funnybase13' database) against the original reads (in the funnybase11
database).

Remember you can use the 'rename' utility (just type 'rename' on the command line)
to rename any reads so that they have the format '162-001-A01.phd.1' (i.e., hyphens
not underlines). (I haven't managed to duplicate the '162--' renamed file problem
but if it happens again, just do 'rename ./ s/--/-/' )

I've added the automated blast checking application to the end of the instructions
(step 8), which I've copied below and attached.

The mapping file must be in tab-separated-value (.tsv) format (i.e., when saving,
use Format: Text(tab delimited) ):

original_expt	original_plate	original_well	reseq_expt	reseq_plate	reseq_well
151	1	F10	162	1	A01
151	1	A09	162	1	B01
151	1	B04	162	1	C01
151	1	H03	162	1	D01
151	1	E11	162	1	E01

I've attached an example of the mapping file.

REM: Excel saves '.tsv' files with the Macintosh 'carriage-return' line ending. 
You have to convert this to the Unix 'line-feed' line endings so that the application
can read the lines correctly. Convert the mapping file with the 'mac2unix' utility:

mac2unix </full/path/to/file>

e.g.,

mac2unix /Users/young/FUNNYBASE/dev/funnybase13/funnybase13.tsv

(Windows has both line-endings so it doesn't need to be fixed.)

This is the output format of 'readsblastcheckresults':

experiment      plate   well    identity        mapped_experiment       mapped_plate    mapped_well
162     001     A01     96      151     001     F10
162     001     A02     95      151     001     E02
162     001     A03     97      151     001     B09
162     001     A04             151     001     E12
162     001     A06     99      151     002     D09
162     001     A07     99      151     002     B08
162     001     A08             151     002     E07
162     001     A09             151     003     D04
162     001     A10     88      151     003     C12
162     001     A11     94      151     003     F04
162     001     A12     89      151     004     D11
162     001     B01     98      151     001     A09
162     001     B02     97      151     001     H12
162     001     B04     97      151     001     F06
...

I've attached the output file for plates 1-8.

Cheers,

Stuart.

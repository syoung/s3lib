#                Welcome to the InterProScan v4.2 installation script.
#
#  Tips:
#     - If you are happy with the suggestion between [], just press <enter>
#     - Whatever is shown between '/' and '/' is considered a valid input pattern

    Reconfigure everything? (first time install) [n] /(y|n)/? : y

! Tip:
!
! InterProScan needs to know where it is installed and where perl is installed
!
    Do you want to set paths to perl and the installation directory? [y] /y|n/? : y

! Tip:
!
! If your servers are using a shared file system, such as NFS, InterProScan is able to utilise this
! and perform distributed computing across multiple servers
! You will need set up the full UNIX path to the installation directory.
! You also need to ensure that the InterProScan installation is on a SHARED DISK.
!
    Please enter the full path for the InterProScan installation [/Users/young/FUNNYBASE/bin/iprscan] /.+/? : /Users/young/FUNNYBASE/apps/iprscan
    Do you want to set another Perl command in place of [/usr/bin/perl]? [n] /y|n/? : n
>>Changing Perl path in scripts ... >>DONE

>>Checking if your Perl installation has the modules required by InterProScan...
>>All modules needed are already installed.


! Tip:
!
! To cope with bulk jobs and to enable efficient parallelization, InterProScan splits input files
! with FASTA formatted sequences into smaller parts (chunks). Default size is "10" sequences per chunk
!
    Do you want to setup chunk size [y] /(y|n)/? : 

! Tip:
!
! Here you should specify the maximum number of sequences allowed in each part (chunk).  Please note
! it is not recommended to have more then 3000 chunks.
!
    Enter chunk size [10] /[0-9]+/? : 


! Tip:
!
! You can configure InterProScan to limit the number of input sequences (protein & nucleotide),
! set a maximum length for nucleotide sequences and a minimum length for protein sequences.
! You can also configure the minimum length for a translated orf and use the codon table value
! to translate the dna/rna sequence into six frames (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/mutations/trtables.cgi).
!
    Do you want to configure this? [y] /(y|n)/? : n


! Tip:
!
! InterProScan currently encorporates searching against 13 databases. You have the choice whether or not to
! set up a particular search tool against a database and how exactly that application will be configured to run
! in this next section. You will configure the queue systems (if any) you will use, first
!
    Do you want to setup applications (if you don't, no applications will be included in InterProScan by default)? [y] /(y|n)/? : 

! Tip:
!
! InterProScan is able to execute the applications via a UNIX QUEUING system which has an INTERACTIVE mode (such as LSF).
! Currently, we mainly support LSF (which is used at EBI) however, we also provide configuration files for other systems
! which are listed in the documentation
!
    Do you wish to use a queue system? [n] /(y|n)/? :

! InterProScan can be launched through a cluster machine using RSH. To be able to utilise this

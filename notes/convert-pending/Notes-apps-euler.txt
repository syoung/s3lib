**** NB: NEED TO SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TO ___RUN___ EULER... ***

You will need to set the following variables, both to install and run euler-sr. You'll be reminded if any are not set since the makefile will issue a warning then quit.
EUSRC 	The full path to the euler-sr directory. You can probably type cd mcsrc; 'setenv MCSRC `pwd`.
MACHTYPE 	The identity of your system's architecture. This will generally be set by the OS, but just in case right now the only valid values are x86_64, i686 powerpc
CC 	Your g++ compiler. If it is in your path this is usually just "g++"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH 	You should include $(MCSRC)/lib/$(MACHTYPE) as part of the library path.
PERL5LIB 	You should include the path to fwg_scripts in PERL5LIB. This is probably ${MCSRC}/fwg_scripts

Once all of these are set, simply unpack the source, and type make. All executables are stored in the $(MACHTYPE) subdirectories of each source directory.

454
===

If you are building 454 sequences, or a hybrid of 454 and Sanger,
use the script CorrectAndAssemble.pl, with a vertex size of 25.  All
the reads should be in one file.  In this case, we'll call it 'reads.fasta'.

>CorrectAndAssemble.pl  reads.fasta -vertexSize 25


SOLEXA
======

If you are assembling Illumina reads, use the driver script tuned to
Illumina.  Since Illumina reads are all the same length, we have an
additional step that takes advantage of this, assuming the read length
is longer than 30 bases.  You can invoke this step by specifying the
read length on the command line with the -readLength option.  In the
example below, 'L' should be replaced by the length of the reads in 'reads.fasta'.
Note it is not necessary that each read length be the same.

<entry [Mon Jul  7 15:15:24 EDT 2008] INSTALL euler>



EULER-SR Readme.   More detailed instructions are on the webpage at
http://euler-assembler.ucsd.edu.

Steps for installing EULER-SR

1. Unzip euler-sr.tgz (most likely already done if you are reading this).

tar zxvf euler-sr.tgz

2. Configure proper environment variables.  You will need these to
both install and run euler-sr. This is described in-depth on the
webpage, but an example for Ubuntu, tcsh, x86_64 architecture follows:

cd euler-sr
setenv EUSRC  `pwd`
setenv MACHTYPE x86_64
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${EUSRC}/lib/${MACHTYPE}
setenv PERL5LIB ${EUSRC}/fwg_scripts
setenv CC g++

IN BASH:

cd euler-sr
export EUSRC=`pwd`
export MACHTYPE=x86_64
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${EUSRC}/lib/${MACHTYPE}
export PERL5LIB=${EUSRC}/fwg_scripts
export CC=g++

echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/store/home/syoung/base/apps/euler-sr/lib/x86_64


Chances are, the only difference you'll have is to change x86_64 to
i686 if you are running on an older machine.

(

USAGE
http://euler-assembler.ucsd.edu/portal/?q=node/78

Assembling Illumina reads

1. Convert FASTQ to FASTA files (if they are fastq), and trim low quality sequences:

eusrc/assembly/x86_64/qualityTrimmer -fastq reads.fastq -outFasta reads.unfiltered.fasta -minQual -span 4

2. Remove the poly-A or poly-C reads that are created when the signal is flooded:
eusrc/assembly_utils/FilterReads.pl reads.unfiltered.fasta eusrc/assembly/matetable.rules reads.fasta

the file 'matetable.rules' contains regular expressions for deciding which technology produces which read, since the filtering changes per technology. The fasta title should match the regular expression provided in the matetable.rules file.

3. Assemble your sequences.
eusrc/assembly/AssembleIllumina.pl reads.fasta working_dir -vertexSize 25

If you're feeling lucky, you can run the latest and greatest but not necessarily most stable code here with:
eusrc/assembly/AssembleIllumina.pl reads.fasta working_dir -vertexSize 25 -tryBeta


Error correction with EULER-SR

If you want to use EULER-SR to correct reads, but (unfortunately) another program to assemble them, that's ok.

There are a few simple steps to error correction. I use two different programs, one for 454 and Sanger reads, and the other only for Illumina. I'll show below where you have to use a different command.

1. Do quality filtering of your data if you have quality values. See the page on quality filtering to do this.

Assuming your filtered reads are reads.fasta:

2. Compute the k-mer frequency

>${eusrc}/assembly/x86_64/integralCountSpectrum reads.fasta 20 reads.spect -printCount -binary

2. Sort the frequency list so that it may be searched. Also take the time to remove very low frequency k-mers.

>${EUSRC}/assembly/x86_64/sortIntegralTupleList reads.spect -printCount

(this last option is necessary)

3. Compute the count where k-mers are equally likely to be errors or correct. This tells you what to use as the 'minMult' option.

>${EUSRC}/assembly/x86_64/estErrorDist reads.spect -binSpect

You should set the minMult option (below) to something a little less than this, to include as many true positive k-mers as possible.

3. Run Error correction, for 454 the best command is:

${EUSRC}/assembly/x86_64/fixErrorsISAP reads.fasta reads.spect 20 reads.fixed -discardFile reads.discards -minMult 8 -maxScore 6 -startScore 2 -stepScore 2 -maxTrim 2 -edgeLimit 4

for Illumina:

${EUSRC}/assembly/x86_64/fixErrorsIVoting reads.fasta reads.spect 20 reads.fixed -discardFile reads.discards -minMult 8 -minVotes 2 -maxTrim 3




Description of the output

base.edge 	The sequence of every edge in the de Bruijn, or condensed de
Bruijn graph. The set of edges in the graph correspond to the
assembly of both the forward and reverse strands. Each edge has a
dual edge that is its reverse complement.
base.contig 	One of every pair of dual edges in the de Bruijn graph. This is
half the number of edges in the .edge
file minus the number of palindromic edges.
base.graph 	An adjacency list representation of the de Bruijn graph. This is
currently retained for compatibility with previous versions of
euler_et and euler_db.
base.bgraph 	

The branching de Bruijn graph (condensed graph) is stored two separate
lists, an edge and a vertex list. Each value in the vertex list
stores the indices of the edges that are incident (either in or out
edges) to that vertex. Each value in the edge list stores the source
and dest vertex, and the length of the edge. The actual sequence of
the edge is stored separately since some programs perform graph
operations that only require topology.

The .bgraph file is a slightly more descriptive version of the
branching de Bruijn graph. A graph with M vertices and N edges is
stored as M lines that describe edges that are adjacent to
vertices, then N lines describing each edge as follows:


Number_of_vertices M
index1 	uvid1 	inG 	inA 	inC 	inT 	outG 	outA 	outC 	outT
...
indexM 	uvidM 	inG 	inA 	inC 	inT 	outG 	outA 	outC 	outT
Number_of_edges N
source 	dest 	mult 	uEID1 	balanced_edge_index 	length
source 	dest 	mult 	uEIDN 	balanced_edge_index 	length

This is designed to be a human readable representation of the de
Bruijn graph. Each vertex has a maximum in and out degree of 4. The
values inG etc. specify the indices of
edges that are incident to the vertex. Each vertex has 4 possible
in-edges corresponding to edges that contain 'g', 'a', 'c', and 't' at
the position k-1 from the end of an edge, where k is the vertex size.
The sentinal -1 is used to show that there is no incident edge
containng the corresponding nucleotide at position n-k-1 (where n is
the length of the edge).
base.report 	Some commands store a log of their command line options to this
file.
base.intv 	A description of how reads map to edges in the de Bruijn graph.
The unit of description of the map is an interval, a tuple
describes the read that maps to an edge, where the intervals starts
on both the read and the edge, and the length of the interval.
This file is in the format:

EDGE N Length L Multip K

INTV read_index read_pos interval_length edge_start

...

N is the index of the edge (in order of the file base .edge file)

L is the length of the edge.

K is the number of reads that map to an edge.

read_index is the index of the read in the file base.

read_pos is the first position in the read that maps
to the edge (in this interval, a read may map to an edge many
times).
interval_length is the length of the read interval on
the edge.
edge_start is the starting position of the read
interval on an edge.

base.path 	The path of edges that every read takes. This file may be
reconstructed by tracing read intervals through the graph, but that
takes time, and so this stores the result of tracing all read
intervals through the graph.
base.ovp 	This is a temporary file output by edgesToOverlapList to easily
search for subsequences of the edges.
base.v 	The list of vertices in the de Bruijn graph. Right now these
are stored as a list of positions in reads, however this may change
to save space.
base.sv 	The same list of vertices, except sorted for easy lookup.





Running assemblies



Running EULER-SR.

   1. Fix errors in reads.
   2. Build the condensed de Bruijn graph.
   3. Remove spurious edges using graph simplification.
   4. Resolve repeats in the graph using equivalent transformation.

For error correction, several programs both with many options exist,
and the correct program and set of options depends on your data.
Fortunately, they have been wrapped into driver scripts that in
addition to controlling some of the options, can split the error
correction problem down across multiple processors, using the Sun Grid
Engine submission system if it exists.

Reads must be stored in just one file. For now assume that file is
called reads.fasta . For assembling
unpaired data, no additional files are necessary.




Two programs exist for correcting errors: fixErrorsSAP (fix
errors Spectral Alignment Problem), and
fixErrorsVoting. The first uses a DP method described in [cite
Chaisson 05] for fixing errors. It is highly accurate for fixing long
reads with errors that have insertions and deletions. The drawback is
that it requires a short section of a read to be error free, and the
read should not end in an error (reads that have errors biased towards
the ends of reads will be difficult to fix). The latter program,
fixErrorsVoting can fix reads that do not have a section that is
error-free, but cannot fix insertions and deletions. It is also quite
a bit more slow. Currently we use fixErrorsSAP to fix errors in 454
reads, and fixErrorsVoting to fix errors in Illumina reads.

The easiest way to run error correction is to use a driver program:

>FixErrorsSerialParam.pl reads.fasta `pwd`/work `pwd`/result -itMult 10 -prog sap

This will compute the tuple-spectrum, and then run fixErrorsSAP on
reads.fasta. Because several intermediate output files are generated,
the script requries the full path to a working directory to output
these files, and the full path to store the result. This is
convenient when working on a grid that has scratch space on each
compute node, and the result needs to be copied to a separate root
directory.

The script is set up to fix errors serially so that
error correction may be ran on the same set of reads with different
parameters, first fixing high coverage regions and ending on lower
coverage regions by specifiying multiple multiplicity values using the
-itMult option.

Here is a more complicated example:

>FixErrorsSerialParam.pl reads.fasta `pwd`/work `pwd/result -itMult 12\
-itMult 10 -itMult 6 -prog sap -nProc 4 -smp

This runs fixErrorsSAP on reads.fasta ,
first fixing reads with a spectrum counting all words with freqency 12
as correct. Reads that were unfixable using a minMult parameter of 12
are fixed with 10, and then 6. The options -nproc 4 -smp split error
correction across 4 processors on a symetric multiprocessor system,
such as a multi-core computer. one could parallize this with the
-grid -nJobs 10 set of options, however this requires a system that is
running the Sun Grid Engine.

If you are uncertain what minimum frequency to use, the
program estErrorDist will guess the
parameters the Gaussian distribution of frequency that the correct
k-mers follow, and the parameters for the exponential distribution
that the erroneous k-mers follow.

The program estErrorDist requires a spectrum, so you can run this in the following way:

>countSpectrum reads.fasta reads.fasta.spect -tupleSize 20
>estErrorDist reads.fasta.spect

If you want more information, such as a histogram of tuple frequencies, or to watch the convergence of the EM method, use the -verbose option.


It's easy to run error correction step by step as well, for example:

>countSpectrum reads.fasta reads.fasta.spect -tupleSize 20
>sortTupleList reads.fasta.spect reads.fasta.spect.sorted
>fixErrorsSAP reads.fasa reads.fasta.spect.sorted 20 reads.fasta.fixed -minMult 6 -maxScore 5 -maxTrim 3 -discardFile reads.fasta.discards




Both the SAP and Voting error correction methods follow roughly the same command line interface:

fixErrors{SAP,voting} readsFile spectrumFile vertexSize fixedReadsFile -minMult M


readsFile: 	The input reads.
spectrumFile: 	A list of (tuple, multiplicity) pairs sorted by tuple.
vertexSize: 	The size of the tuple in the spectrum file.
fixedReadsFile: 	The outputFile for reads.
-minMult M 	The minimum frequency of a tuple to consider correct. While this is an optional parameter, it is a good idea to configure this according to the coverage of your project. There are programs to help you guess a good value for minMult.



Simplifying the de Bruijn graph



SimplifyingTheDeBruijnGraph.html
After constructing the de Bruijn graph, any extra errors that remained
in reads after error correction create extra edges in the de Bruijn
graph. Graph correction operations clean this up.

The most simple way to perform an entire assembly is with the script AssembleAndCorrect.pl

${MCSRC}/assembly/AssembleAndCorrect.pl reads.fasta -vertexSize V

This script wraps the assembly post-processing steps:

   1. Graph correction.
   2. Joining sources and sinks.
   3. Graph simplification using reads.
   4. Graph simplification using mate-pairs.

To correct (simplify) the graph, you run:

>simplifyGraph reas.fasta reads.fasta.simple -vertexSize V -minEdgeLength E -removeSimpleBulges B -removeLowCoverage
>joinsas reas.fasta.simple L reads.fasta.simple.j -vertexSize V
>ReorderAndLink.pl reads.fasta.simple.j reads.fasta
>euler_et -s reads.fasta.simple.j.r -x V -o reads.fasta.simple.j.r.et.dot

The graph correction defined in [Chaisson 08] are implemented in the
program simplifyGraph . Errors at the
ends of reads create short source and sink edges in the graph, and are
removed by the parameter minEdgeLength.
As a rule of thumb, this length should be less than the length of a
read. Errors in the middles of reads create bulges, and may be
removed with the parameter removeSimpleBulges
. This should be at least 2 * vertexSize + 1. Errors that
make fake chimeric reads create paths in the grath that not many reads
follow, usually just one. When the
removeLowCoverage option is used, reads that create paths that
appear an unexpectedly low number of times are removed. If all reads
on an edge have been removed, the edge is removed as well.

Often this is enough to remove nearly all erroneous edges in a graph.
When the genome is complicated and contains a large number of
high-identity repeats, assembly may benefit from graph simplification
instead of just correction. The removeBulges
option will replace complicated networks of cycles with a
topology that represents replacing a repeat with the consensus
sequence.

The process of creating the de Bruijn graph splits edges where the
read overlap is more than vertexSize
nucleotides apart. We repair overlaps with the program joinsas that joins source and sink edges whose
sequences have unambiguous overlaps.

Finally, in order to run the programs euler_et
, and euler_db the format of the
graph needs to be changed a bit to be compatible. This may be done
with the script ReorderAndLink.pl .




Quality filtering

We only use quality files to trim bad reads, and not during assembly. To filter quality, use the program qualityTrimmer

If you have a quality file:

${EUSRC}/assembly/x86_64/qualityTrimmer -fastA reads.fasta -qual reads.qual -outFasta reads.trimmed.fasta -minQual 10 -span 4

This truncates reads after the average quality drops below 10 for 4 nucleotides.

If you have a fastq file, you do not need to specify a quality file, but the command changes:
${EUSRC}/assembly/x86_64/qualityTrimmer -fastQ reads.fastQ -outFasta reads.fasta -minQual 10 -span 4


Transforming the de Bruijn graph


After correcting errors in the de Bruijn graph, you may resolve
repeats using euler_et and euler_db.

euler_et bases the names of all input
files as suffixes of the original reads file, and so if the graph file
name after simplification is
base.simple.{bgraph,graph,edge,...}, there needs to be a link to the
original reads file named base.simple. The script ReorderAndLink.pl creates the appropriately
linked files.

To run euler_et:

>euler_et -s base.fasta -x V -o base.fasta.et.dot

You specify the source file with the -s
option, the vertex size with the -x
option, and the resulting graph viz file with the -o option. This graphviz file is only for
visualization purposes.

If you are running euler_et without mate-pair information, the
assembly quality may be improved by performing an X-cut and tandem
repeat removal (straightening).

>euler_et -s base.fasta -x V -o base.fasta.et.dot -X -S

If you have paired end reads, you can further transform the graph
using euler_db. Information for read-pairing is encoded in the fasta
names for each read, so you may need to re-format your data
accordingly.

First, you will need a file called name.rul
that describes the clones that are used. The following is an
example (and should just be copied and modified)

/* Names are: Library_Plate_well.primer
primer library plate length range */
Single reads: s ALL ALL
Double-barreled reads: a b ALL ALL 550 650
Double-barreled reads: c d ALL ALL 1900 2300
Double-barreled reads: e f ALL ALL 9100 11100

The format of a read name is
name_library_plate.ext

Name may be any series of letters and numbers without '_'. Library
and plate should be integers. When 'ALL'
is specified for library or plate, the library and plate are ignored,
otherwise reads from only that library or plate are used. Finally the
length range is the expected range of length from the end of the
forward read to the beginning of the mate. The extension 'ext'
specifices which clone a read is.

Thus a sample set of unpaired and paired sequences in a FASTA file is
as follows:

>sim_1_3.s
TGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGCTTCTGAACTG
>sim_1_4.s
TAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGCTTCTGAACTGGTTACCTGCCGTGAG
>sim_1_5.a
TGATAGCAGCTTCTGAACTGGTTACCTGCCGTGAGTAAATTAAAATTTTA
>sim_1_6.b
GAACCCCGGCTGGGCGGCGGCGAGTCCCGTCAAAAGTTCGGCAAAAATAC

Finally, you need a mates file that
describes the pairing of reads. Each line of this file is of the
format:


name_library_plate i j m


In this case, name_library_plate is a paired or unpaired read, i and j are the
indices of two reads in the reads file, and
m is the number of the double-barreled rule in the file
'name.rul' that applies to those reads. This information is redundant
with the extension, and will likely be changed in a subsequent
revision.

An example of this file is as follows:

sim_1_5 5 6 0
sim_1_7 7 8 0
sim_1_9 9 10 0
sim_1_15 15 16 0
sim_1_17 17 18 0
sim_1_19 19 20 2


using amos package with EULER-SR output

    * Questions

Hi,

I'm contemplating using the amos validator to get an impression of the quality of euler-sr output. But I don't see any obvious way to convert the euler-sr output to an amos bank or get the mapping of reads to the generated contig to write a converter.

I'm sort of stuck because if said mapping is not available I don't think I can construct a amos-bank.

Thanks for any pointers I might have missed.

The current distribution now
On July 24th, 2008 mchaisso says:

The current distribution now has the cmpAssemblies program included. You can see shuffled assemblies with:

cmpAssemblies ref.fasta assembly.contigs -onlyBad

(without the -onlyBad option, you will get a map of all contigs back to the reference)
I'm not sure what the output
On July 16th, 2008 mchaisso says:

I'm not sure what the output is required for AMOS validation. I have a simple program that I use to find misassemblies that I'll include in the source distribution that may be ran using:
cmpAssemblies genome.fasta assembly.fasta

and concise output mode:
cmpAssemblies genome.fasta assembly.fasta -onlyBad

this does the mapping for you, and prints the coordinates of contigs that are gapped or shuffled around (the gap must be greater than some small value, 10 or so).

Otherwise, I'm more busy than normal now and probably can't write anything to help the amos comparison, most likely until the end the month.

The "directory not found" error is saying that the shared NFS  
directories failed to mount for some reason.  There are lots of  
possible causes for this.  The most common one is that the portal  
rebooted, and the nodes were not rebooted after that.  The simplest  
thing to do is to reboot the node in question.  If that doesn't  
resolve things, we can debug along the following lines:

* Verify that the node can actually mount the directories:

mkdir test_mount
mount portal2net:/Users test_mount

The most common reasons I've seen for this to fail are if a node  
cannot resolve "portal2net" (a name provided by the DNS server on the  
portal), or if the portal is not properly exporting the directories.

Reading through your email, it sounds like this is exactly what is  
happening?

If you've turned off DNS on the portal, you will need to either re- 
activate it or provide some other way for the nodes and the portal to  
identify themselves on the private network.  iNquiry sets this up by  
default.  Did you deactivate it?

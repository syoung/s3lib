<entry [Fri Mar  13 17:14:32 EST 2009] 1000 GENOMES FTP DATA - INDEX OF ALL DATA SETS >



INDEX FILE IS HERE

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/sequence.index
or
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/sequence.index 

This is a tab-separated file whose format is documented here: 
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/README.sequence.index  or
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/README.sequence.index

This file should provide you with sufficient data to download subsets of files by 
individual, pilot, technology etc. This index also contains the md5s for the fastq 
files


FROM README:
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/README.ftp_structure


The 1000genomes project has two mirrored ftp sites:
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk and ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ 

These follow this basic structure.

At the top level there are 3 directories:

data
release
technical
changelog_details

==== data ====:
 contains a subdirectory per individual of the project. Each individual directory
contains series of subdirectories for different data sets like sequence reads, sequence alignments etc.

e.g  ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/data/NA12878/sequence_reads/SRR003082.recal_1.fastq.gz 
or   ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/data/NA12878/sequence_reads/SRR003082.recal_1.fastq.gz

==== release ==== 
 contains dated directories which contain analysis results sets released on
that date plus readmes explaining how those data sets were produced.

e.g ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/release/2008_12/
or  ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/release/2008_12/

==== technical ==== 
 contains subdirectories for other data sets like simulations or files for
method development interm data sets etc.

e.g ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/technical/simulations
or  ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/technical/simulations

=== changelog_details ===

In order to make the main root-level CHANGELOG human-readable, and scrollable, when changes are made
involving lareg moves or renames of files, these are referenced in the CHANGELOG and placed in this
changelog_details directory. Wherever possible (in all cases so far) these will be in programmatically 
parseable format. Thus far they are all have column 1: old file location, column 2: new file location,
which will also allow for renaming.


=== Index ===

The volume of data generated by 1000genomes project is unprecedented. Therefore in order 
to find and easily download the sequence_read files you need an index file is provided: 
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/sequence.index or
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/sequence.index 

This is a tab-separated file whose format is documented here: 
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/README.sequence.index  or
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/README.sequence.index

This file should provide you with sufficient data to download subsets of files by 
individual, pilot, technology etc. This index also contains the md5s for the fastq 
files

But when the process is runnning in the background, prompting is not allowed and the process cannot proceed without authentication.System action:Processing stopped.User response:You may use RUNASSERVICE option with PASSWORDACCESS PROMPT. Turn off RUNASSERVICE to be able to get prompted

CORRESPONDENCE
++++++++++++++
Stewart:Yes you need two accounts but as you will see there is no need to typethe account ID and password every time.  This information is cached bythe backup client and you only enter it the first time.I've created the ID's Genomics and Gems, the passwords are the samerespectively. The rsync I don't believe will be necessary because your system willnever back up to tape. The files will be backed up to disk first andlater during the day our server will move them from disk to tape. Thisis done to ensure the highest transfer rate possible.regardsTom VegaInformation Technology - OperationsUniversity of MiamiPh: 305-284-3922-----Original Message-----From: stuart young [mailto:youngstuart@hotmail.com] Sent: Thursday, July 27, 2006 4:37 PMTo: Vega, TaumelCc: dcrawford@rsmas.miami.eduSubject: RE: backupHi Taumel,I'd like to install it first on two machines:129.171.101.233 (genomics.rsmas.miami.edu)129.171.101.102 (gems.rsmas.miami.edu)As for backup start times, anytime between 2AM and 4AM would be fine.I'm not sure about the bandwidth from RSMAS to your centerDo I need two users or can I access the same backup location with justone user from both computers?I was also wondering if I can use rsync with your system to synchronise filesystems on your front-end server before they are transferred totape?Best regards,Stuart.>From: "Vega, Taumel" <tvega@miami.edu>>To: "stuart young" <youngstuart@hotmail.com>>CC: <dcrawford@rsmas.miami.edu>>Subject: RE: backup>Date: Thu, 27 Jul 2006 16:23:33 -0400>>Stewart:>>>>You may download the TSM Backup client from the following location:>>ftp://129.171.46.29  (if the link doesn't work then copy and paste it>into your browser)>>>>user: tsm>>pass: client>>>>download the folder "Mac v5.3" to your computer and read the file>TSM532C_MAC.README.FTP for Installation Instructions>>I've attached a set of detailed installation instructions for windows>which can serve you as a guide for installing it in your Mac>environment.>>>>Once you're ready to install this client we will need to know the>machine name so that we can create an account for you.

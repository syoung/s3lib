====== View .ace files with Hawkeye ======

This help page is based on [[http://amos.sourceforge.net/hawkeye/index.html#launching|Hawkeye homepage]]
[[http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/3/R34|Hawkeye paper]]


------
Hawkeye is launched on the Linux command line application so to open it on Windows you have to install an X-windows emulator, such as WinAXE:

[[winaxe|How to connect with WinAXE]]   

------

**Launching Hawkeye**


1. On the command line in your X-window emulator, type the following to copy a demo .ace file to your current folder:

    cp /home/syoung/base/apps/amos/demos/demo1.ace ./

2. Convert this .ace file into a .bnk directory for input into Hawkeye:

    toAmos -ace demo1.ace -o - | bank-transact -m - -b demo1.bnk -c

3. View the .bnk directory with Hawkeye (click 'Contig View' once the X-window opens)

    hawkeye demo1.bnk

{{:hawkeye:hawkeye_contig.png|}}


======

You can see the complete list of Hawkeye command Line options using the -h option:

    hawkeye -h


    Usage: hawkeye [options] [bankname [contigid [position]]]
    Options:
      -c <path>   Add a chromatogram path
      -D <DB>     Set the chromatogram DB
      -T          Enable Trace Fetch cmd
      -p <port>   Initialize Server on this port
      -K <kmer>   Load File of kmers
      -h          Display this help


A typical execution will be "hawkeye prefix.bnk" which will load the assembly from the bank named prefix.bnk. Specifying a path with -c allows you to set a location for the viewer to find the chromatograms for the project. You may set multiple paths, and hawkeye will search each one. Similiarily, the -d option also specifies locations for the chromatograms, but this is for "TIGR style" naming schemes to be used in conjunction with the -D option. More work is under development to simplify chromatogram access. The -p option allows you to set a TCP port for Hawkeye to accept commands from, especially for integration with [[http://mummer.sourceforge.net/manual/#mummerplot|mummerplot]].

<entry [Thurs Feb 5 10:18:42 EST 2006] DETECTING HIV VARIANTS WITH NGS>



Thurs 5th Feb

HIV variant detection threshold = 0.2%


SHENZHEN BGI

BGI will do 3 terabases this year for 1000 genomes

2.4 terabases needed to get 400X coverage to detect variants in transcripts with copy number of 1

Panda - all solexa sequences, 2kb, 5kb, 10kb inserts. Assembly algorithms:  


ABI SYMPOSIUM

80% of SNPs matched dbSNP

4m SNPs found in human

50bp reads show 0.1% error at 50th cycle



Tom Hudson: Genbiomic variation and cancer

Won't call SNP unless at least 10X


Andy Futreal, Sanger Center. Structural Somatic Variations in Cancer.

Use paired end 400bp for ends of chromosomes where expect structural rearrangements

400bp is a nice distance because can design PCR primers for it

Solexa copy number variation more reliable than Affy array



Bioinformatics

Dave Dooling, Wash U. "Next Generation Informatics" 
Design and implementation of a generalized laboratory data model

object relational mapping (ORM) layer
Workflows in XML
massively parallel across a cluster - atuomatically spawn jobs

Allow analysts to create a thin wrapper around tools and then run with automated job tracking, retries, failure logging

Easy Perl API

EVENING BIOINFORMATICS SECTION

David Mcbride, Sanger


both 400 kb 

whole genome amplification does not affect 400 bp paired end results, didn't try 3kb yet


Structural varian mapping - need to exhaustively map pairs
Simulations as acontrol for FP


Aaron Quinlan, U Virginia

Tracing mappings from LTR's takes up most of the data processing

20,000 pairs generate 9 billion hits

1. Wrote own pipeline, tested BWA from Heng Li (MAQ) gapped alignment finds all optimal hits - gets concordant pairs (normal) and discordant pairs (downside: doesn't find all the suboptimal hits - e.g., labelled as discordant because didn't find the suboptimal hits.)

2. Novoaligh (colin hercus et al) --> RefMapper (Clark, Quinlan, Hall) - get concordant pairs missed by BWA, and get discordant pairs, then use MASV (mapping based assembly of SV) to cluster by mapping distance and orientation and position on chromosome

31.4 mill, 30.3m concord, 98k discorandt, etc

12 million discordant mappings -> 614 putative SVs:

half a re due to genome assembly problems due to repeats (collpased), 6% span gaps in genome (false positives), 
92 treu SVs, most due to transposon insertions 

this vaariation was seen after just 10 generation of mice

Tried denovo on T lympocytes reads but unmapped reads highly unmined

HMM - transition matrix: transition between loss, neutral and gain, diagonal on matrix should contain most of the probability



Todd Wylie, Wash U Technology develoment. miRNA deep sequencing


Jay Shendure

calling 84% of bases, so False Negative theoretically is at least 16%
dbSNP correspondence 93% (CEU), 83% (YOR)
HapMap 2+3 99.8%

FDR of ~ 5% (i.e., among all non-dbSNP, novel variants based on cross-validation.??? )

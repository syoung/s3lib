Hi Doug,

Here's my summary of the last week and plan for the week of June 11th:

1) Karenia5 (from last week)


Karenia 5 is done and up on sandbox16. Please note that it is a much reduced data for the following reasons:

    -  applied 75bp length cutoff for entering singlets into the database
        2815 out of 6206 singlets added to 'assemblysequences' table
        2496 out of 2694 contigs added to 'assemblysequences' table

        compared to the default 50bp cutoff:
		3068 out of 6206 singlets added to 'assemblysequences' table
		2516 out of 2694 contigs added to 'assemblysequences' table


    - added poly-A tail filter (chops off anything after a 10bp poly-A repeat)

    
2) Funnybase11

    - refactored existing software and added new scripts to deal with adding supercraw0 sequences to funnybase11
    
        (e.g., populating assemblyreads and assemblysequences tables), including:

        readsfastasingletssqualfile.pl
        readsfastacontigsqualfile.pl
        supercraw0reads.pl
        supercrawreads.pl
        comparemultiplecollectionannotation.pl
        comparemultipleextractassemblysequences.pl
        indexfasta.pl
                
 	- compared to funnybase10
    

3) Website

    - sandbox16, sandbox17, sandbox18 - progressive modularisation, object oriented (OO) implementation
    
        DONE: Blast page (ADDED initialise FUNCTION)
        DONE: Stats page (Object-Oriented perl script to generate data, OO Javascript function to present data)

    - 80% DONE:  Uploads function with Drag n Drop
    
    - TO DO: ADD SNP stats to Database stats

    - TO DO: Bios for Doug, Margie, Amy, Jeff, Dean, Meredith, Stuart, Tim
    
4) Thesis research
     
        TO DO: Run Decision Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers using orthologues data
     
5) Pathways annotation
       
        DONE: Pathway annotation using fuzzy matches of GO descriptions with swissprot annotations
     
        TO DO: Add to funnybase11 annotation, including HTML or SVG display
        
6) Annotation
     
    TO DO: Check points below
     
     
    >IMPORTANT:
    >    A   There are two task:  we need to but the data and figures 
    >about "The problem with Annotation"
    >          1:   X% OF Y number of Human refseq are not annotated.

<entry [Tue May 15 22:15:51 EDT 2007] TO DO FOR WEEK OF Monday May 14th, 2007>




Hi Doug,
 
Sorry about the delay in getting this to you.

Here's a summary of the last week and my plan for the week of Mon 14th May:

1. karenia3 ASSEMBLIES COMPARISON

REVISED Comparison FUNCTION:

http://genomics.rsmas.miami.edu/sandbox16/sandbox16.html

View --> Comparison


ADDED Read OPTION TO SEARCH FUNCTION OF sandbox16:

Search --> Simple Search --> SELECT 'Read' in scrollbox


REFACTORED arraycompare.pl:

    - FASTER, DOES readnames AND numberreads


REINSTATED TRANSITIVE READS IN COLLECTION:

NB: The reason why some reads didn't show up earlier was mainly because they
were transitive reads and so not entered into the 'reads' and 'assemblyreads' tables.

(REDID assemblyreads AND assemblysequences TO INCLUDE ALL TRANSITIVE READS)

 

2. funnybase10 COLLECTION

CREATED supercraw0reads TO ADD supercraw0 READS TO funnybase10
    
    NAME        supercraw0reads.pl
    
    PURPOSE
    
        1. COPY THE READS FROM supercraw0 TO funnybase10
        
        2. supercraw0 DOES NOT HAVE THE FIELDS filteredsequence
            AND filteredquality, SO ADD THESE (COPY screenedsequence
            AND screenedquality)
        

	USAGE
    
        supercraw0reads.pl [-h] 

        -h help              : print this help message
	

CREATED assemblyengine.pl TO DO THE BASIC ASSEMBLY FROM START TO FINISH

    ./assemblyengine.pl <-d database> [-s stage] [-h]


CREATED arraycompareengine.pl TO RUN arraycompare.pl ON THE CLUSTER

    ./arraycompareengine.pl <-d database> <-a cap3_argument> <-r argument_range> [-n number_assemblies]


3. Thesis research
 
    TO DO: Run Decision Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers using orthologues data
 
4. dbEST submission
 
    - Do you want to submit them? Only experiment 130 is missing the 'Library' description. Apart from that, expts 126, 151-158 are ready to submit. 
 
5. Funnybase website
 
    TO DO: Database stats, snp stats, uploads
    TO DO: Bios for Doug, Margie, Amy, Jeff, Dean, Meredith, Stuart, Tim 
 
6. Pathways annotation
    
    95% DONE: Pathway annotation (by building synonym tables) using fuzzy matches of GO descriptions with swissprot annotations 
 
7. Annotation
 
   TO DO: Create 'collectionsequencessvg.pl' to include
          - BLAST hits
          - IPRSCAN hits
 
8. Annotations paper:
 
    TO DO: Check points below
 
 
>IMPORTANT:
>    A   There are two task:  we need to but the data and figures  
>about "The problem with Annotation"
>          1:   X% OF Y number of Human refseq are not annotated.

Hi Doug,

Here's my summary of last week and plan for this week:

dbEST submission

    TO DO: Format unannotated sequences in required format and submit.
    
    TO DO: Format annotated sequences in required format (after pathway annotation completed) and submit.
    

Crawford Lab website 

    TO DO: Introduction for welcome page, Bios: Doug, Margie, Amy, Jeff, Dean, Meredith, Stuart, Tim 

Funnybase website

    DONE: Refactored search output for faster precalculation and better display

    80% DONE - add bookmark function

    TO DO: update fileseek

    TO DO: add Pathway results to search output

Pathways annotation
    
    DONE: I've extracted the EC terms from all Swissprot entries (180,000) to be used as a supplementary lookup table, in addition to the existing mapping table.

    50% DONE: Pathway annotation (by building synonym tables) using fuzzy matches of GO descriptions with swissprot annotations which we discussed last week.

Additional tasks

    DONE: The Aplysia analysis (see following email)
            
            -  cumulative assembly of Aplysia experiments to show change in reads vs ESTs/contigs/singlets (i.e., adding more reads gives more ESTs, not yet 'flattening out')
            
            -  BLAST of subtracted experiment (JUVE-L1-17) against all database, compared with 95%, 99% and 99.9% confidence interval limits of BLAST of all other
                JUVE experiments against the database (in all cases hits against ESTs containing the reads being BLASTed are ignored)

Thesis research

    - DONE: Debugging iprscan on the orthologues from unigene (based on hits for the 100 human unigenes)

    - TO DO: Decision Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers using orthologues data


Stuart.

Hi Sawsan,

Thanks to Camilo and Zhijie's invaluable input I was able to concentrate on getting the KEGG data. Since KEGG wasn't returning much data using gene ID queries, I tried aligning our sequences against the whole KEGG Database using KAAS (Kegg Automatic Annotation Server, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas). This produced a list of KEGG IDs for those of our APS-related sequences with alignment 'hits' against the KEGG database sequences. I mapped these KEGG IDs manually to their pathways in the attached Excel file: 
genes-kegg.xls

If you click on the linked entries in each column, it'll take you to the relevant KEGG page. The most interesting is probably the 'PATHWAY' column , which takes you to a pathway page where the hit protein is outlined in red. The 'ALL HITS' column links to images of the 'hit' pathways where all of the KEGG entries in the pathway that aligned with our APS genes are marked in green. The 'KEGG ENTRY' column links to the specific information page on that KEGG ID and the 'KEGG SEARCH' column takes you to a general search of the whole KEGG database using the KEGG ID. You can also click on the 'Sequence file' column entries to get the fasta sequences.

There are three candidates that should be ranked highest in terms of their involvement in multiple pathways:

von Willebrand factor (VWF)
coagulation factor II (thrombin) (F2)
serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E (nexin, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1), member 1 (SERPINE1)

All three of them are involved in the 'Complement and coagulation cascades' pathway which contains all of the other APS-related genes.

Given the hypothesis that APS is due to a convergence of breakdowns in different pathways, it may be these genes that straddle multiple pathways that are the most likely to cause multiple disturbances in downstream pathways in the event of disfunctions in the gene product or the regulators of the gene product. Alternately, multiple abberant inputs from upstream pathways acting on one gene product may also be a cause of the disease, in which case these multi-pathway genes could be implicated.

By the way, there is also a nice graph (browseable like GoogleMaps) of the complete metabolome here:
http://www.genome.jp/kegg/atlas/metabolism/view.rb?korg=1218948454

Regarding the Pathway Studio analysis, Camilo extracted the relations using the MedScan tool (the input was the Genbank IDs of the APS-related genes). From amongst all of the extracted relations, the GO names with the highest number of common objects ranked by p-value are in the attached excel file:

medscan_GO_terms.xls

Among the top 20 terms, the following correspond quite nicely with the KEGG pathways described above:
 
blood coagulation
Ligands
immune response
fibrinolysis
Receptors
cell-cell signaling
cell surface receptor linked signal transduction
negative regulation of coagulation

But these terms might bear further scrutiny:

extracellular region
inflammatory response
extracellular space
Extracellular proteins
soluble fraction
protease binding
calcium ion binding
lipid transporter activity
leukocyte migration
plasminogen activator activity
serine-type endopeptidase activity


I haven't had time so far but if Johnny would like more analysis after he sees what we have tomorrow, I could still do the Reactome analysis and perhaps use other interaction databases to get a more fine-grained idea of any possible links between the genes in the list and other APS-related pathways, and also look into chromosomal locations.

Cheers,

Stuart.

Hi Studart,

It is odd! 
I used these 34 gene IDs from accessions_only file to search pathway in GeneSet Analyszer and Bibliosphere, but neither program suggested any pathway. Bibliosphere shows: No entries in database for "190881474 190881475 190881476 168480078 160358824 32562993 32562991 27849956 27849955 27849954 27849953 27849952 27849951 27849950 27849949 433730 433728 433735 433733 433731 89191867 183979970 192448441 115430250 119395710 169808403 70906436 70906438 109389366 192447437 169790801 34335271 50541941 149999607".  And GeneSet Analyszer generated nothing.

I checked these 34 gene IDs in NCBI, they are alright. I also checked these two programs using one of my old dataset (1499 1291 2099 5594 2064 6794 5604 5290 5054 2475 57111 6194), and multiple pathways were suggested by these two programs as usual.

One thing I noticed is that most of these 34 genes are pretty new, so they probably are not yet included in Genomatix Database.

Any result from Pathway Studio?

Best
Zhijie

Hi Zhijie,

 

Hope you're having a good weekend so far. The MIHG folks are very keen
to get the results of the pathway analysis by Monday and I was wondering
if you could try using GeneSet Analyzer sometime today to identify any
pathways of interest from the Genbank gene accessions in the file
'accessions_only.txt' in the 'clinical.zip' file attached? If you have
more time, it'd be great if you could try using Bibliosphere to look for
interactions in the literature but let me know how much you can do.

 

Cheers,

 

Stuart.

Subject: Help with Pathway Studio

 

Hi Camilo,

 

I need your help with Pathway Studio - I've got a set of genes but can't
analyze them with the Demo version of Pathway Studio. Could you take a
look at the file 'accessions_only.txt' in the 'clinical.zip' file
attached and see if you can create a project with these Genbank IDs?

 

Are you around at 2.30pm? If not please call me 305-781 2286 and we can
try to arrange to meet later this afternoon.

 

Just to fill you in on the background, the Genbank IDs belong to Genbank
entries for the following the list of candidate genes that are
associated with the disease APS (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or
'thrombotic storm'):

 

1.       Antiphospholipid antibody

2.       ADAMTS13

3.       Anti-heparin/PF4 antibodies

4.       Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A

5.       Antithrombin, protein C and Protein S

6.       Factor VIII and fibrinogen

 

And here are the candidate pathways (with genes) that we'll want to look
at for possible overlaps/connections between the pathways (can you do
that kind of analysis with Pathway Studio?):

 

1.       Target antigens

Beta-2-glycoprotein I, prothrombin

 

2.       Hemostatic mechanisms

 

Activated Protein C pathway

Tissue factor complex

Von Willembrand factor pathway

Fibrinolytic pathway

 

3.       Immune Mechanisms

 

Complement factor H

HLA

 

4.       Cytokines

 

Tumor necrosis factor alpha

High mobility group box 1 protein

Pathway Studio
===========

Paper describing Pathway Studio's MedScan literature-parsing relation finder and its output ResNet database.
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/171
Yuryev 2006 Automatic pathway building in biological association networks
Yuryev  et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2006 7:171   doi:10.1186/1471-2105-7-171

Currently, Medscan technology extracts relations between proteins, small molecules, protein functional classes, cell processes, and diseases. These relations can be divided into two major classes: direct physical interactions and indirect regulation events. The direct physical interactions include three types of relations:

• Binding (Binding)

• Protein modification (ProtModification)

• Promoter binding (PromoterBinding).

The indirect interactions include:

• Regulation (Regulation)

• Expression regulation (Expression)

• Molecular transport regulation (MolTransport)

• Molecular synthesis regulation (MolSynthesis).

Regulation is the most abundant relation type in ResNet, reflecting the most common way scientists express their thoughts about protein signaling. The ResNet database contains information about proteins from human, mouse and rat organisms. The orthologs from these three species are merged in one node in ResNet (10). Relations found by Medscan are annotated by organism, but algorithms described in this paper do not use this information. Complete statistics for every relation type in ResNet database are presented in Table 1.

...
Relations in ResNet are generated from multiple literature sources including the entire PubMed database containing 13,000,000 scientific abstracts and 43 publicly available full-text journals. Medscan processes individual sentences and does not accumulate the information about all other relations in the literature corpus during parsing. As a consequence, the same biological relation expressed differently by different authors will be recorded as two different relations by Medscan.
...
Medscan recovers about 60% of all relations per sentence in the text. This rate enables nearly 100% detection for all facts that are repeated more than once in the literature corpus. Most single-reference facts are usually re-stated several times in a single full-text article, enabling Medscan to recover unique single-referenced relations with high certainty as well. We estimate that the most recent Medscan pipeline, version 1.8, extracts 90% of all facts described in the scientific literature. About 10% of all relations found by Medscan are false positive.

GEO
===

Can extract profile neighbours and chromosome neighbours but only gene-by-gene, i.e., there is no batch query system.

What I would like to do is upload a list of gene names or gene IDs and get any correlations between the genes such as sharing the same profile and/or lying close together on the same chromosome.

KEGG
=====

Since KEGG wasn't returning much data using gene ID queries, I tried aligning our sequences against the whole KEGG Database using KAAS (Kegg Automatic Annotation Server, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas). This produced a list of KEGG IDs for those of our APS-related sequences with alignment 'hits' against the KEGG database sequences. I mapped these KEGG IDs manually to their pathways in the attached Excel file:

genes-kegg.xls

If you click on the linked entries in each column, it'll take you to the relevant KEGG page. The most interesting is probably the 'PATHWAY' column , which takes you to a pathway page where the hit protein is outlined in red. The 'ALL HITS' column links to images of the 'hit' pathways where all of the KEGG entries in the pathway that aligned with our APS genes are marked in green. The 'KEGG ENTRY' column links to the specific information page on that KEGG ID and the 'KEGG SEARCH' column takes you to a general search of the whole KEGG database using the KEGG ID. You can also click on the 'Sequence file' column entries to get the fasta sequences.

There are three candidates that should be ranked highest in terms of their involvement in multiple pathways:

von Willebrand factor (VWF)
coagulation factor II (thrombin) (F2)
serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E (nexin, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1), member 1 (SERPINE1)

All three of them are involved in the 'Complement and coagulation cascades' pathway which contains all of the other APS-related genes.

Given the hypothesis that APS is due to a convergence of breakdowns in different pathways, it may be these genes that straddle multiple pathways that are the most likely to cause multiple disturbances in downstream pathways in the event of disfunctions in the gene product or the regulators of the gene product. Alternately, multiple abberant inputs from upstream pathways acting on one gene product may also be a cause of the disease, in which case these multi-pathway genes could be implicated.

By the way, there is also a nice graph (browseable like GoogleMaps) of the complete metabolome here:
http://www.genome.jp/kegg/atlas/metabolism/view.rb?korg=1218948454


ALTERNATELY:
Downloading KEGG genes for BLAST against our genes, then search through KEGG pathways for any pathways that are statistically overrepresented in the BLAST hits.

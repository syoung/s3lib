<entry [Wed Apr 14 17:57:36 EDT 2010] INSTALL GreenHopper ON gaia>




Welcome to GreenHopper 101, an introductory guide to the GreenHopper plugin for JIRA and a tour of the most interesting GreenHopper features. Use this page to guide your evaluation process or quickly get up to speed with GreenHopper.

The intended audience for this document is software developers who are familiar with Agile methodologies.


1. Installing GreenHopper
=========================

1. Download GreenHopper
(If you have a .zip simply rename your file as a .jar — Internet Explorer is playing tricks on you.)


2. Shut down JIRA.

bin/shutdown.sh


3. Replace or copy the jar into the {JIRA_HOME}/plugins/installed-plugins directory
(Windows default {JIRA_HOME} is C:\Program Files\Atlassian\Application Data\JIRA)

cp /nethome/syoung/base/apps/jira/jira-greenhopper-plugin-4.4.jar /usr/share/jira/data/4.1/plugins/installed-plugins


4. Remove any jira-greenhopper-plugin-*.jar from your {JIRA_INSTALL}/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/lib directory.

rm -fr /usr/share/jira/4.1/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/lib/*green*

5. Restart JIRA

bin/startup.sh


6. Install license

Obtain GreenHopper license, or generate an evaluation license, via your Atlassian account.

Log in as a user with the 'JIRA Administrators' global permission.
Click the 'Administration' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'JIRA Administration'.
Click the 'Licence Details' link under the 'GreenHopper' section of the administration menu. This will display the 'GreenHopper License' screen.

Enter your license details and click 'Add'.

OK

***GreenHopper license must match JIRA license***
***Please note, if you are using a commercial (i.e. not an evaluation) license for GreenHopper, it must match your JIRA license. For example, if you have a JIRA 25 User Commercial license you must have a GreenHopper 25 User Commercial license. GreenHopper evaluation licenses do not need to match JIRA licenses.***


7. Install the Labels Plugin: (click to expand)

It is recommended that you install the Labels Plugin so that you can utilise Epics in your GreenHopper projects.


1. Download the Labels plugin

/nethome/syoung/base/apps/jira/jira-labels-plugin-2.4.jar


2. Shutdown JIRA

bin/shutdown.sh


3. Copy the jar to   {JIRA_HOME}/plugins/installed-plugins directory

cp /nethome/syoung/base/apps/jira/jira-labels-plugin-2.4.jar /usr/share/jira/data/4.1/plugins/installed-plugins


4. Remove any jira-greenhopper-plugin-*.jar from your {JIRA_INSTALL}/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/lib directory.

rm -fr /usr/share/jira/4.1/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/lib/*label*
* No such file *


5. Restart JIRA

bin/startup.sh


The JIRA Labels Plugin gives you the ability to tag issues with arbitrary labels. What are tags? They are simple, one word descriptors that help you organize issues. Check out the del.icio.us explanation or the one from Flickr-- JIRA Labels work just like that.

Once installed, you can add a 'Labels' custom field to any project, and you'll be able to add new labels to an issue from the View Issue screen or from the Edit Issue screen. You'll also be able to add tags to lots of issues quickly by using the Issue Navigator.




2. Configuring GreenHopper
==========================

Before you begin: Note that you will need the 'JIRA Administrators' global permission and the 'Administer Projects' project permission to perform the tasks in this section. You will also need to have created at least one JIRA project.

Configuring GreenHopper for Scrum: (click to expand)
If you set your GreenHopper projects to use the 'Scrum' template, your projects will automatically be configured to use Stories, Epics, Story Points, Ranking and Flagging.

Tip: You have the flexibility to configure the GreenHopper 'Default' template and/or the GreenHopper 'Scrum' template to your organisation's needs — please see the documentation on Specifying your Project Templates. Further, individual projects can override the templates to suit their requirements — please see Configuring your General Project Settings.

To set a project to use the 'Scrum' template:
Click the 'Agile' menu in the top navigation bar. The 'Planning Board' (or 'Task Board' or 'Chart Board', depending on the last board you visited) will be displayed.
Click the 'Tools' menu near the top right, then click 'Configuration' from the dropdown menu provided.
Select your project from the project dropdown (next to 'PROJECT CONFIGURATION'), if it is not already selected.

In the 'Project Template' dropdown, select 'Scrum'.
Configuring Constraints: (click to expand)
You can implement one of the most useful Kanban concepts by simply adding Column Constraints to your Task Board. If the constraints for a column are exceeded, the column will be highlighted in red.

To set constraints based on the number of issues in a given column:

1. Click the 'Agile' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'Task Board'.
2. Click the 'Views' menu at the right of the screen and select 'Compact (Kanban)' from the drop-down menu.
3. Select the project for which you wish to set a constraint.
4. In the appropriate column (e.g. the 'In Progress' column), click the black arrow in the top right of the column.
5. Click 'Column Constraints'.
6. Click the 'Edit' link for the 'Standard Issue Count' field, and enter the maximum in the 'Capacity' field. E.g. if your business practice is to have no more than 5 issues 'In Progress' at any one time, you would specify 'Max'=5.'Standard' issues exclude sub-tasks.
7. Click 'Update'. Your changes will be saved.
8. Close the 'Column Constraints' window. Your Task Board will refresh with the column constraint applied. If the total number of issues in that column of your Task Board exceeds the maximum capacity, the column will be highlighted in red.

For more information, please see the documentation on Adding Constraints to your Task Board Columns (Kanban).



3. Configuring JIRA
===================

Before you begin: Note that you will need the 'JIRA Administrators' global permission and the 'Administer Projects' project permission to perform the tasks in this section. You will also need to have created at least one JIRA project.

  Setting up a Version Hierarchy: (click to expand)
You may want to create 'master-slave' relationships between versions, e.g. you could group sprints under a release version ('Sprint 1', 'Sprint 2', etc) under the version for the major release ("Version 1").

To set up a version hierarchy, e.g. to break up your major version into sprints:
Click the 'Agile' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'Planning Board' from the drop-down menu.
In the 'PLANNING BOARD' field, select the project in which you are interested.
In the column at the right of the screen, click the 'Add' link. The 'Add Version' popup will appear.
In the 'Version Name' field, type the name of your new sprint version (e.g. 'Sprint 1').
In the 'Master' field, select your major version (e.g. 'Version 1').
Enter the 'Start Date', 'Release Date' and 'Decription' for your new sprint version.
Click the 'Create' button to create the verion and keep the 'Add Version' popup open (so you can create another version, e.g. 'Sprint 2'), or click the 'Create and Close' button to create the version and return to the Planning Board.
For more information, please see the GreenHopper documentation on Setting Up a Version Hierarchy and the JIRA documentation on Managing Versions.

To force all issues to respect the hierarchy you have set up, you can 'synchronise' versions and components. You can do this either manually or automatically; for more information, please see the documentation.

To synchronise your versions automatically:
Click the 'Administration' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'JIRA Administration'.
Click the 'General Configuration' link under the 'GreenHopper' section of the administration menu.
In the 'GreenHopper Listeners and Services' section, click the 'Versions Synchronizer' check-box.
  Enabling Time-Tracking: (click to expand)
If you want to be able to log the amount of time you spend working on issues, you need to first enable time-tracking in JIRA.

To enable time-tracking::
Click the 'Administration' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'JIRA Administration'.
Click 'Time Tracking' (under 'Global Settings') in the left navigation column.
In the 'Hours Per Day' field, enter the number of hours in your organisation's working day (e.g. 8).
In the 'Days Per Week' field, enter the number of days in your organisation's working week (e.g. 5).
Leave the 'Time Format' as 'pretty'.
Change the 'Default Unit' to 'hour'.
Click the 'Activate' button.
For more about configuring time-tracking, please see the JIRA documentation.
  Enabling Sub-tasks: (click to expand)
If you want to be able to split up a 'parent' issue (e.g. a 'Story') into a number of sub-tasks which can be assigned and tracked separately, you need to first enable sub-tasks in JIRA.

To enable sub-tasks:
Click the 'Administration' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'JIRA Administration'.
Click 'Sub-Tasks' (under 'Global Settings') in the left navigation column.
Click the 'Enable' link.
For more about configuring sub-tasks, please see the JIRA documentation.
Working with Issues

4. Viewing the "To Do" List
  To view the "To Do" list for your project or yourself: (click to expand)
Click the 'Agile' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'Task Board' from the drop-down menu.
In the 'TASK BOARD' field, select the project in which you are interested.
 Tip: the Task Board will not be displayed if you have not yet configured a version for your project.
In the 'View Version' field, select the version in which you are interested.
If you wish to see only the issues that are assigned to you, click the 'My Issues' check-box.
For more information, please see the documentation on Using Task Board Modes to View Issues.

5. Creating an Issue
  To log one or more new issues/cards: (click to expand)
Click the 'Agile' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'Planning Board' (or 'Task Board' or 'Chart Board') from the drop-down menu.
In the 'PLANNING BOARD' (or 'TASK BOARD' or 'CHART BOARD') field, select the project in which you wish to create an issue.
Click the 'New card' button (next to the project dropdown).
Fill out the 'New issue' form (this is similar to creating a new issue directly in JIRA).
Click the 'Create' button to create the issue and keep the 'New issue' window open (so you can create another issue), or click the 'Create and close' button to create the issue and return to your board.
For more information, please see the documentation on Creating an Issue in GreenHopper and Creating an Issue in JIRA.

6. Flagging an Issue
Flagging a card/issue indicates that it requires special attention.

  To flag an issue: (click to expand)
Click the 'Agile' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'Planning Board' (or 'Task Board' or 'Chart Board') from the drop-down menu.

Find the issue and double-click it to display it as a 'Detailed Card'.
Click the black triangle in the top right corner of the card and select 'Flag' from the drop-down menu.
For more information, please see the documentation on Flagging an Issue in GreenHopper

7. Ranking Issues
Ranking your issues/cards helps you organise and prioritise tasks in your product/sprint backlog more effectively.

  To rank issues in your project: (click to expand)
 Tip: If the currently selected project is using the 'Scrum' Project Template you may skip the steps below as it sets the 'Sort by' field of the Default context to 'Rank' automatically.

Click the 'Agile' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'Planning Board' from the drop-down menu.
In the 'PLANNING BOARD -' field, select the project in which you are interested.
In the 'View' field, select 'Project Overview'.
In the 'Context' field, select 'On the fly'.
Click the 'Tools' menu at the right of the screen and select 'Context' from the drop-down menu.
In the 'Sort by' field, select 'Rank' (i.e. the Ranking field that you set up in 'Configuring JIRA and GreenHopper' above).
You can now rank your issues by dragging and dropping the cards/rows on your Planning Board as desired.
For more information, please see the documentation on Ranking Issues in GreenHopper.

8. Scheduling and Assigning Issues
  To schedule and assign issues/cards: (click to expand)

Drag and drop the desired card(s)/row(s) to the version (or component or assignee) to which you want to assign the issue(s).
 You can select multiple cards by using the <Control> (or <Command>) key.
For more information, please see the documentation on Scheduling and Assigning Issues in GreenHopper.

9. Transitioning Issues through Statuses
  To move an issue from one JIRA status to another: (click to expand)
Click the 'Agile' menu in the top navigation bar and select 'Task Board' from the drop-down menu.
In the 'TASK BOARD' field, select the project in which you are interested.
In the 'View Version' field, select the version in which you are interested. Please note, you will not be able to select 'Unscheduled' or any released versions in this dropdown.
Drag and drop the desired card(s)/row(s) to the column that matches the status to which you want to assign the issue(s).
For more information, please see the documentation on Transitioning Issues in GreenHopper.

 Note for Kanban users: if moving an issue causes a constraint to be exceeded, the affected column will be displayed in red.

2. CREATE jira USER

A dedicated user should be created to run JIRA, as JIRA runs as the user it is invoked under and therefore can potentially be abused.


/usr/sbin/useradd --create-home --home-dir /usr/local/jira --shell /bin/bash jira

OK




3. DOWNLOAD JIRA TO INSTALLATION DIRECTORY

cd /usr/share/jira

wget http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/atlassian-jira-enterprise-4.1-standalone.tar.gz




4. SET jira.home IN jira-application.properties FILE

CREATE JIRA HOME DIRECTORY

mkdir -p /usr/share/jira/data/4.1
cd /usr/share/jira/4.1
chown jira:jira /usr/share/jira/data/4.1


FIND AND EDIT jira-application.properties 

find ./ -name jira-application.properties

	./atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/jira-application.properties

emacs /usr/share/jira/4.1/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/jira-application.properties

ADD

	jira.home	/usr/share/jira/data/4.1


*** Please note that you cannot use the same JIRA home directory for multiple instances of JIRA. We recommend that you do not specify your JIRA home directory to be inside your installation directory, to prevent information from being accidentally lost during major operations (e.g. backing up and restoring instances). ***

You cannot access JIRA at present. Look at the table below to identify the reasons

Description
The jira.home directory '/usr/share/jira/data/4.1' is already locked. Please see the JIRA documentation for more information on locked jira.home directories.

DIAGNOSIS

jira.home WAS LOCKED IN PREVIOUS ABORTED INSTALL ATTEMPT

Your JIRA home directory can become locked if you accidentally configure two JIRA instances to use the same directory or your JIRA instance terminates abnormally and fails to unlock the JIRA home directory. This will prevent your JIRA instance from running.


SOLUTION:

1. CD to the JIRA Home directory

cd /usr/share/jira/data/4.1

2. Run ls -al
	
	[root@gaia 4.1]# ls -al
		drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Apr 14 17:25 caches
		drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Apr 14 17:25 data
		drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 14 17:25 export
		-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    0 Apr 14 17:25 .jira-home.lock
		drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 14 17:25 log
		drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Apr 14 17:25 plugins

3. Run rm .jira-home.lock

	[root@gaia 4.1]# rm -fr .jira-home.lock

1. CREATE A jira USER

A dedicated user should be created to run JIRA, as JIRA runs as the user it is invoked under and therefore can potentially be abused.

    sudo /usr/sbin/useradd --create-home --home-dir /usr/local/jira --shell /bin/bash jira

2. DOWNLOAD jira

http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/JIRADownloadCenter.jspa


3. UNZIP AND RUN bin/startup.sh

cd /home/syoung/19-jira/
ll

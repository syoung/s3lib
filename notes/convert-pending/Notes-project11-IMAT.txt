Exploring inconsistencies in genome-wide protein function annotations: a machine learning approach
BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:284doi:10.1186/1471-2105-8-284


***************************************
In this study, we have limited our attention to sequence-based machine learning methods for annotation of protein sequences. With the increasing availability of other types of data (protein structure, gene expression profiles, etc.), there is a growing interest in machine learning and other computational methods for genome-wide prediction of protein function using diverse types of information [34-39]. Such techniques can be applied in a manner similar to our use of sequence-based machine learning to identify potentially erroneous annotations in existing databases.

Abstract
Background

Incorrectly annotated sequence data are becoming more commonplace as databases increasingly rely on automated techniques for annotation. Hence, there is an urgent need for computational methods for checking consistency of such annotations against independent sources of evidence and detecting potential annotation errors. We show how a machine learning approach designed to automatically predict a protein's Gene Ontology (GO) functional class can be employed to identify potential gene annotation errors.
Results

In a set of 211 previously annotated mouse protein kinases, we found that 201 of the GO annotations returned by AmiGO appear to be inconsistent with the UniProt functions assigned to their human counterparts. In contrast, 97% of the predicted annotations generated using a machine learning approach were consistent with the UniProt annotations of the human counterparts, as well as with available annotations for these mouse protein kinases in the Mouse Kinome database.
Conclusion

We conjecture that most of our predicted annotations are, therefore, correct and suggest that the machine learning approach developed here could be routinely used to detect potential errors in GO annotations generated by high-throughput gene annotation projects.

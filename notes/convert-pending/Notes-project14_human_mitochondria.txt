    The goal of generating large amounts of sequence data from closely related organisms is driving the application known as resequencing, which handles the sequence data in different ways than de novo assemblies of genomes. In resequencing, the assembly is guided by a reference sequence and requires much less coverage (8–12times) than assembling genomes de novo (25–70times). One study using this approach sequenced 10 mammalian mitochondrial genomes16, thus enabling population-genetic studies based on complete mitochondrial genomes rather than just short sequence intervals. Currently, many microbial sequencing projects are underway that will not only help to expand the number of available genomes, but also enable many comparative studies that will link genotype and phenotype at the genomic level.

    Although the application of sequencing-by-synthesis techniques to DNA extracted from bones has revolutionized the study of ancient DNA, it has been plagued by large fractions of contaminating environmental DNA. The genetic analyses of hair shafts could be a solution: The authors present 10 previously unexamd. Siberian mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) mitochondrial genomes, sequenced with up to 48-fold coverage. The observed levels of damage-derived sequencing errors were lower than those observed in previously published frozen bone samples, even though one of the specimens was >50,000 14C years old and another had been stored for 200 years at room temperature The method therefore sets the stage for mol.-genetic anal. of museum collections.

<entry [Sat Oct  6 18:49:46 EDT 2007] RESET ROOT PASSWORD>




1. REBOOT HOLDING DOWN Apple + S (single-user mode) OR Apple + V (verbose)

(To exit single-user mode type: reboot)

2.  IT WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE:

<datetime>
Singleuser boot: fsck not done
Root device is mounted read-only
If you want to make modifications to files, run:

/sbin/fsck -y
	
and then

/sbin/mount -uw /


SO DO BOTH BUT CAN'T DO passwd mclean (FREEZES FOR A WHILE THEN RETURNS NEW PROMPT)

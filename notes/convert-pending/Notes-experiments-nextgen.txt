1. Family history - do linkage study, areas with LOD of 1 to narrow down areas of interest to ~20% of genome

2. Run 4 individuals - for each individual get a list of ~3,800 SNPs (majority will be non-synonymous and hence deleterious). Find the genes with SNPs that they share in common
    
3. Do 1,000-individual genotyping to check if there are SNPs/deletions in the same genes in the general population

Hi Doug,

Here's the link for the BLAST hit distributions:

The 'overall distributions' are all there - put your mouse over a graph bar and click the first option in the popup menu. I'm still working on the 'ordinal distributions' (e.g., diff. between 1st and 2nd evalue for each sequence) trying to get round some memory constraints.

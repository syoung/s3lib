At least one other one is svg2png. I've used it on Mac OS X just
fine. You can find it at:

	http://cairographics.org/snapshots/

We don't yet have pre-compiled packages for Mac OS X available, so to
make it work, one would need to grab the following tar files:

	libpixman
	cairo
	libsvg
	libsvg-cairo
	svg2png

and compile each in turn.

If someone wanted to maintain OS X binary packages for any of the
above, I'd be glad to host them, (we already have binary packages for
Debian i386 here: http://cairographics.org/packages/debian/).

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

INSTALL cairo:
    cd /Users/young/FUNNYBASE/NOTES/gui/SVG/svg2png/cairo-1.3.4
    ./configure

GOT ERROR:

configure: error: pkg-config >= 0.19 required but not found (http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/)

INSTALLED DEPENDENCY pkg-config:

INTALLED DEPENDENCY libpng

PROBLEM:

configure: error: Cairo requires at least one font backend.
                  Please install freetype and fontconfig, then try again:
                  http://freetype.org/  http://fontconfig.org/

PROBLEM CONFIGURING fontconfig:

Please update fcarch.tmpl.h and rebuild
make[3]: *** [fcarch.h] Error 1
make[2]: *** [all] Error 2
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2

1. POSSIBLE SOLUTION:

./configure --with-arch=PPC
DIDN'T WORK

2. POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=--with-arch=ppc BUT COULD NOT FIND FILE mk.conf

Subject: fonts/fontconfig 2.4.0 on OS X 10.4.7 build failure
To: None <pkgsrc-users@netbsd.org>
From: Mark E. Perkins <perkinsm@bway.net>
List: pkgsrc-users
Date: 09/13/2006 16:38:15

Building the latest fontconfig on OS X 10.4.7 ends with:

rm -f fcarch.h
./fc-arch auto < ../fc-arch/fcarch.tmpl.h > fcarch.h
./fc-arch: unknown signature
"12345678_00000001_00000004_00000004_00000004_00000010_00000004_00000004_00000008_00000004_00000004_0000000c_00000004_00000004_00000010_00000004_00000004_00000002_00000020_00000004_0000001c"
        Please update fcarch.tmpl.h and rebuild
gnumake[3]: *** [fcarch.h] Error 1
gnumake[2]: *** [all] Error 2


The problem seems to be that configure determines the system architecture by
running '/bin/arch' and '/usr/bin/arch -k'. The problem is that /bin/arch does
not exist on OS X and /usr/bin/arch does not accept any command line arguments.

A temporary fix is to set CONFIGURE_ARGS+=--with-arch=ppc in mk.conf, but
that's just a bandaid on the real problem.

Is there a quick (and more permanent) fix that can be applied or is this worth
a PR?

Thanks,
Mark

3. POSSIBLE SOLUTION:

declare -x PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig
THEN ./configure
DIDN'T WORK

4. ? SOME RELATED STUFF ONLINE...


INSTALL libsvg:

checking for libxml-2.0 >= 2.4.7 ... Package libxml-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libxml-2.0.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable No package 'libxml-2.0' found
configure: error: Library requirements (libxml-2.0 >= 2.4.7 ) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.


INSTALL libsvg-cairo:

INSTALL svg2png:



SOLUTION:

    DROP CAIRO AND INSTALL INKSCAPE:


PROBLEM:

    cd /Users/young/apps/inkscape/inkscape-0.44.1
    ./configure
    ...
    configure: error: libgc (the Boehm Conservative Collector) 6.4+, is needed to compile inkscape --   

INSTALLED libgc OK BUT GOT THIS ERROR:

error: --enable-lcms was specified, but appropriate LittleCms development packages could not be found

	INSTALLED liblcms1-dev FROM DOWNLOADED lcms_1.15.orig.tar.gz	==	OK

THEN DID ./configure IN ~/apps/inkscape/inkscape-0.44.1 AND GOT THIS ERROR:

checking for INKSCAPE... configure: error: Package requirements (gdkmm-2.4  glibmm-2.4  gtkmm-2.4  gtk+-2.0 >= 2.4.0  libxml-2.0 >= 2.6.11  libxslt >= 1.0.15  sigc++-2.0 >= 2.0.12    gthread-2.0 >= 2.0 libpng >= 1.2) were not met:

No package 'libxml-2.0' found
No package 'libxslt' found
No package 'sigc++-2.0' found
No package 'gthread-2.0' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables INKSCAPE_CFLAGS
and INKSCAPE_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

SO DID:

cd /Users/young/apps/inkscape/inkscape-0.44.1
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig
echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH

BUT GOT THE SAME ERROR AS ABOVE:

checking for INKSCAPE... configure: error: Package requirements (gdkmm-2.4  glibmm-2.4  gtkmm-2.4  gtk+-2.0 >= 2.4.0  libxml-2.0 >= 2.6.11  libxslt >= 1.0.15  sigc++-2.0 >= 2.0.12    gthread-2.0 >= 2.0 libpng >= 1.2) were not met:

No package 'gdkmm-2.4' found
No package 'glibmm-2.4' found
No package 'gtkmm-2.4' found
No package 'gtk+-2.0' found
No package 'sigc++-2.0' found
No package 'gthread-2.0' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables INKSCAPE_CFLAGS
and INKSCAPE_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.


SO TRIED BUT GOT SAME AS ABOVE:

./configure INKSCAPE_CFLAGS="" INKSCAPE_LIBS=""

THEN CHECKED /usr/lib FOR THE ABOVE SIX LIBRARIES - NOT FOUND IN /usr/lib.

Hi Doug,

Here's my summary of the last week (Dec 11-15):

- Reconfigure cluster, set up NFS share on genomics
    # completed

- BLAST stats 
       Chi-squared test of whether the distributions are the same (overall E-value distributions) between 
bars (groups of hits-per-sequence)
    # completed

COARSE GRAIN BINS

FINE GRAIN BINS

    Mouseover menu for overall E-value distribution per bar and distribution of difference between ordinal (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) E-value per bar. Results show significant differences in both overall and ordinal distributions between most bars. Fine-grain graph (*.bins100.svg) shows principal, hits distribution in more detail.

- funnybase9 sequence quality stats 
       Distribution of quality values of 'funnybase9' assembled sequences 

    # completed

This has the quality values (x-axis) binned by number of sequences (y-axis), with mouseover menu to view subdistribution per bar or list of sequences contained in bar.


- Run interproscan on unigene data (orthologous groups)
    Run on 1) orthologous groups and 2) orthologous groups with close hits
   
   # incomplete - troubleshooting iprscan with SGE (sun grid engine)

- Website flexible uploaad
     # incomplete

- Add personnel summaries and pictures
      # incomplete

My plan for the next week (Dec 18-22):

- Run interproscan on unigene data (orthologous groups)
    Run on 1) orthologous groups and 2) orthologous groups with close hits

- Website flexible uploaad
       Upload to user-specific folders, new BLAST databases, etc.

- Add personnel summaries and pictures


Stuart.

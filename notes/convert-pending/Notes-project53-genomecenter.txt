That is a good question.  There are 4 different tools I would recommend archiving for QC purposes, and these are many of the same tools we use in troubleshooting.

The Status.xml, the IVC.htm, Summary.htm, Error.htm, and Interop folder.  As you’ve noted, some of these do require some additional files or reference folders to be functional.  Here is what you would need:

-	For the Status page, you’ll need to archive the Status.xml, Status.xsl, and the entire “reports” folder (all located in Data)
-	For the IVC page, you’ll need to archive the IVC.htm and the “plots” folder (all located in Basecalls)
-	For the Error page, you’ll need to archive the Error.htm and the “plots” folder (all located in Gerald)
-	The InterOp folder (from the main root run folder)

Best,

Hello, 

We are in the process of archiving GA data.  I am wondering what files/folders must be saved in order to keep the functionality of the Status.xml file. Ie…<run folder>\Data\Status.xml

Also, what other QC run metrics files wld you recommend keeping.  The IVC and Error and BustardSummary for ex?   Thanks, bill

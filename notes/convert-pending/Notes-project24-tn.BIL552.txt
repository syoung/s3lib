Subject: RE: Network location of T:CCS-Bioinformatics-Shared -- disregard!

Hi again,

I just tried using this address to map the drive manually:

\\medfs03\CCS-Bioinformatics-Shared

But it gave this error:

The mapped network drive could not be created because the following error occurred:
A device attached to the system is not functioning.

Is it a problem at my end?

Cheers,


3. SHOULD APPEAR AS:

    T:\\medfs03\CCS-Bioinformatics-Shared

Hello everyone,

I have placed on the T drive a copy of the syllabus for course BIL552 that Zhijie ,Stuart, and I will be teaching this semester.  We may be calling on your help for some of the classes, and please feel free to attend any of them.  

To get to the T drive, go to your computer’s Map Network Drive dialogue box and put T:\\medfs03\CCS-Bioinformatics-Shared in the query box. You need to be on campus or VPNed in for this to work.

Thanks,
Sawsan

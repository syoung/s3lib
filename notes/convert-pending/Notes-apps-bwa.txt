<entry [Tue Feb  2 16:59:32 EST 2010] COPIED BWA TO apps ON PEGASUS FROM KRONOS>



NOTE: CONTAINS solid2fastq.pl FOR CONVERSION OF csfasta TO fastq

/nethome/syoung/base/apps/bwa/0.5.0


./bwa

    Program: bwa (alignment via Burrows-Wheeler transformation)
    Version: 0.5.0 (r1200)
    Contact: Heng Li <lh3@sanger.ac.uk>
    
    Usage:   bwa <command> [options]
    
    Command: index         index sequences in the FASTA format
             aln           gapped/ungapped alignment
             samse         generate alignment (single ended)
             sampe         generate alignment (paired ended)
             dbwtsw        dBWT-SW for long queries
    
             fa2pac        convert FASTA to PAC format
             pac2bwt       generate BWT from PAC
             pac2bwtgen    alternative algorithm for generating BWT
             bwtupdate     update .bwt to the new format
             pac_rev       generate reverse PAC
             bwt2sa        generate SA from BWT and Occ
             pac2cspac     convert PAC to color-space PAC
             stdsw         standard SW/NW alignment

./solid2fastq.pl 

    Usage: solid2fastq.pl <in.title> <out.prefix>
    
    Note: <in.title> is the string showed in the `# Title:' line of a
          ".csfasta" read file. Then <in.title>F3.csfasta is read sequence
          file and <in.title>F3_QV.qual is the quality file. If
          <in.title>R3.csfasta is present, this script assumes reads are
          paired; otherwise reads will be regarded as single-end.
    
          The read name will be <out.prefix>:panel_x_y/[12] with `1' for R3
          tag and `2' for F3. Usually you may want to use short <out.prefix>
          to save diskspace. Long <out.prefix> also causes troubles to maq.

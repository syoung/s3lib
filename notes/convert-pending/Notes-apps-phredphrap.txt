PATH INFORMATION REQUIRED IN SCRIPTS

THE SCRIPTS IN /User/young/FUNNYBASE/apps/consed/scripts DIRECTORY:

addReads2Consed.perl
findSequenceMatchesForConsed.perl
phredPhrap
tagRepeats.perl
transferConsensusTags.perl

REQUIRE THE CORRECT PATHS FOR THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES:

$szConsedHome = "/Users/young/FUNNYBASE/apps"
$szCrossMatchExe = $szConsedHome . "/phrap/cross_match";$
$cross_matchExe = $szConsedHome . "/phrap/cross_match";
$phredExe = $szConsedHome . "/phred/phred";
$phrapExe = $szConsedHome . "/phrap/phrap";
$phd2fasta = $szConsedHome . "/phred/phd2fasta";
$transferConsensusTags = $szConsedHome . "/consed/scripts/transferConsensusTags.perl";
$polyPhredExe = $szConsedHome . "/polyphred/polyphred";
$determineReadTypes = $szConsedHome . "/consed/scripts/determineReadTypes.perl";
$szDefaultVectorFile = $szConsedHome . "/User/young/FUNNYBASE/pipeline/vector.seq";


# NOT NEEDED 
# $tagRepeats = $szConsedHome . "/bin/tagRepeats.perl";
#$tagRepeats = $szConsedHome . "/bin_common/tagRepeats.perl";


ALSO COMMENT OUT THIS LINE IN phredPhrap:

# !system( "$tagRepeats $szAceFileToBeProduced" )
#   || die "some problem running $tagRepeats $!";

UNLESS WE WANT TO USE IT:

Create a file

/usr/local/genome/lib/screenLibs/repeats.fasta
or
$CONSED_HOME/lib/screenLibs/repeats.fasta

if you are not using /usr/local/genome for the root of the Phred/Phrap/Consed files.)

In this file, put any sequences (in FASTA format) that you want to have automatically tagged.
These typically are ALU sequences. 


NB: ALL OF THE SCRIPTS APPEAR TO REQUIRE THAT THE COMMAND IS GIVEN FROM WITHIN THE edit_dir DIRECTORY


SEQUENCING CHEMISTRY INFO REQUIRED

RUNNING phredphrap GIVES THE FOLLOWING ERROR:

 unknown chemistry (KB_3730_POP7_BDTv3.mob) in chromat ../chromat_dir/127-001_B03.ab1
    add a line of the form
    "KB_3730_POP7_BDTv3.mob"    <chemistry>      <dye type>      <machine type>

Phred uses data from a chemistry parameter file called 'phredpar.dat'
    in order to identify dye primer data.  For dye primer data, phred
    identifies loop/stem sequence motifs that tend to result in
    CC and GG merged peak compressions.  It reduces the quality values
    of potential merged peaks and splits those peaks that have certain
    trace characteristics indicative of merged CC and GG peaks.  In
    addition, the chemistry and dye information are passed to phrap.

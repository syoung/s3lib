Subject: Rhode Island NextGen conference - Sept 23-25

Hi Sawsan,

The NextGen conference is the one we talked about a while back as a possible choice of conference for me this year. It’s being held concurrently with another conference on Integrative Data Analysis that MIHG might also send me to.

Next-Generation Sequencing Data Analysis (Sept 23-25)
http://www.healthtech.com/sda/overview.aspx

As new sequencing platforms are capable of generating gigabytes of data in a single sequence run - leading to terabytes of data in an experiment; data storage, transfer, and analysis will unquestionably be the rate limiting steps in turning the new sequence data into knowledge. CHI’s Inaugural Next-Generation Sequencing Data Analysis convenes engineers who are developing the sequencing platforms, biological researchers who are designing and running the experiments, biostaticians who are analyzing and interpreting the data, and software developers who are managing and storing the data. Each specialty provides perspectives and must be integrated into a cohesive, comprehensive team to decipher the sequencing data deluge. 

Integrative Data Analysis (Sept 23-25)
http://www.healthtech.com/mda/overview.aspx?c=649

Genomic research has become a discipline to be integrated with clinical medicine. Currently, genomic technologies allow for the simultaneous quantification of gene activity in tissues and cells from patients. Will these genomic technologies make it possible to develop personalized medicine, leading to a more accurate diagnosis and prognosis for every patient, and subsequently, a tailored treatment strategy? With the addition and linkage of clinical parameters disparate data points are created. All agree data integration is crucial.  Join innovators from technological platform development, biostatistical analysis, biological, pharmaceutical, and clinical research as they share their experiences and insights for Integrative Data Analysis: Is Personalized Medicine at Hand?

Here’s the list of HealthTech upcoming conferences:

Subject: RE: APS bioinformatics analysis

No immediate concerns other than when it is - we are gearing up to formally launching CCS in November and will need Stuart here for the 2 weeks before and during the launch.  In addition, we have organized weekly bioinformatics workshops for graduate students in October which everyone in the Bioinformatics Program will be involved in teaching, and even though Stuart does not need to be there for all of them, I would need to know sooner rather than later which one(s) he will miss.
 
CCS pays for postdocs to go to one conference per year, and within the Bioinformatics Program we have a preference for this one conference to be in bioinformatics.  Stuart will be the one to decide if this is the right one for him to attend, we will have to clear this ultimately with Nick.
Thanks,
Sawsan

Hi Sawsan,
 
I asked Johnny to forward you the conference information. It covers Nextgen sequencing analysis. Neither Johnny or I will be able to make it because of the timing, but I think it would be very worthwhile for Stuart to attend. Let me know if you have any additional questions/concerns. We’d be willing to cover the costs unless CCS would consider doing so. 
 
Also, when you’re back in town, the two of us should schedule a phone call or meeting at CRB to catch up on things.

Hello there,
Could you give me some more details about this conference please?
Thanks,

Thanks for the info Stuart.  Also, I got the ok from Dr. Gilbert concerning sending you to the Rhode Island Nextgen Sequencing Conference. 
We just need to work out the details of getting you signed up, etc. We can discuss further on south campus Wednesday. 
 
thx, Dale

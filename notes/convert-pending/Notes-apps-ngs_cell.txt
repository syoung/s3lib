Hi Stuart,

As I mentioned on the call, we are making a pre-release version of our
new accelerated, genomic sequence assembler the NGS Cell available to a
select group of potential users and looking for feedback, particularly
on how well it fits your needs with regards to input and output formats
and reporting. 

This program has a simple command line interface and can
be scripted.  It is VERY fast and can potentially assemble to reference
sequences of any size, given sufficient RAM and CPU resources.

The more graphical Genomics Workbench 2.0 version can read the output CAS files
from the NGS Cell.

*About the NGS Cell*
The CLC NGS Cell is the command-line version of our Next-Generation
Sequencing assembly and includes a suite of programs to assemble and
analyze the results. The major feature is reference assembly of short and
long reads to reference sequences of all sizes. Note that the de novo
assembly is not included in this version.

*Installation and availability*
When you go to www.clcbio.com/cell_download, simply click the relevant
platform and follow instructions. Note that the NGS Cell is available for
all platforms, but only Linux has a special 64-bit version. Note that a 64
bit system will be able to use the 32 bit version, but it will not be able
to utilize more than 4GB of memory. Let us know if you would be
interested in 64 bit versions for Windows and Mac.

*Demo license*
I have attached here a demonstration license that will activate the NGS
Cell until Oct. 15.  You will need to place this file in the
working directory of the program.

*Manual*
The user manual is also available from www.clcbio.com/cell_download.

Please stay in touch and let us know if you encounter any difficulty,
and what you think of this program.

Thanks Stuart.

Best Regards,

-Rob

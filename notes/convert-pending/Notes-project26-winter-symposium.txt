Short reads not aligned by assemblers

zee Suggests using novoalign

Reads that aren't matched by Eland are interesting because we would suppose that they're not repeats because Eland reports the matches with multiple locations. 
I would say that gaps in a read would probably be missed by Eland, so use a short read aligner that can find gaps on these reads. I've been using novoalign (www.novocraft.com) and it can find up to 7/8 gaps in a 36bp read matching to a reference sequence, and fast on large ones. I've even tested it on simulated data with mutation rates in excess of 15% and it still finds them. Use a very high threshold e.g. -t 200 to find potentially all permutations for your read.
I'd be interested to know how much more you may be able to match out of your Eland NM reads.

Downloaded novoalign and installed on Solexa

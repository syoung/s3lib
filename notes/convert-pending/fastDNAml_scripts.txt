                          fastDNAml and DNArates



                                SUMMARY

                SCRIPTS THAT INVOKE DNAML OPTIONS


GENERAL COMMENTS:

The program fastDNAml takes data from standard input.  Thus, to run the
program with data in the file called "infile", the command would be

  fastDNAml <infile

In this case, the output goes to standard output (generally the user's
terminal).  To put in into a file, one can use output redirection as in

  fastDNAml <infile >outfile

Because of the use of standard input, the input to fastDNAml can by
preprocessed by a function, and then piped to the program.  For example,

  bootstrap <infile | fastDNAml >outfile

       or

  bootstrap 137 <infile | fastDNAml >outfile

can be used to add the bootstrap option and a random number seed to the input,
and then pass it on to fastDNAml for analysis.

Many of the fastDNAml options are amenable to this arrangement.  In
each case, the preprocessing can simply add options (and auxiliary data
lines, as necessary) to the input.  In addition to avoiding the need to play 
with UNIX text editors, there are several advantages to this approach:

   1. The files remain relatively compatible with PHYLIP DNAML.
   2. It reduces the chance of introducing errors into the data.
   3. It is easier to try alternative options on the same data.
   4. If the data for each sequence are provided in one long line (so that
      interleaved and non-interleaved formats are the same), then some text
      editors will truncate the lines.

Shell scripts are available for each of the above program options.  The
corresponding formats and effects are described below.


THE SCRIPTS:


BOOTSTRAP (B)

  Format:   bootstrap [random_seed]

  Example:  bootstrap <infile.phylip | fastDNAml >outfile
  Example:  bootstrap 137 <infile.phylip | fastDNAml >outfile

Adds a bootstrap option and a random number seed to the input.  If the random
seed is not supplied, then the process ID of the bootstrap shell is used.  Thus,
repeated executions of the first example will tend to generate different random
samples (note that many systems only use about 32000 process IDs, so once you
get above 100 repetitions, reuse of the same number may become a significant
concern).


CATEGORIES (C)

  Format:  categories categories_data_file
  Example: categories archae.rates <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml >archaea.out

Adds the categories option and the corresponding data to the input.  The data
must have the format specified for PHYLIP dnaml 3.3.  The first line must be
the letter C, followed by the number of categories (a number in the range 1
through 35), and then a blank-separated list of the rates for each category.
(The list can take more than one line; the program reads until it finds the
specified number of rate values.)  The next line should be the word Categories
followed by one rate category character per sequence position.  The categories
1 - 35 are represented by the series 1, 2, 3, ..., 8, 9, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z.
These latter data can be on one or more lines.  For example,

  C  12  0.0625  0.125  0.25  0.5  1  2  4  8  16  32  64  128
  Categories  5111136343678975AAA8949995566778888889AAAAAA9239898629AAAAA9
              633792246624457364222574877188898132984963499AA9899975

or, with more categories,

  C 35   0.16529   0.29525   0.34482   0.40272   0.47035   0.54933   0.64157
         0.74930   0.87512   1.02207   1.19369   1.39413   1.62823   1.90164
         2.22096   2.59389   3.02945   3.53815   4.13227   4.82615   5.63654
         6.58301   7.68841   8.97943  10.48723  12.24822  14.30490  16.70694
        19.51232  22.78878  26.61541  31.08459  36.30423  42.40033 256.00000
  Categories  4HHZ282111 21ED48H1HD Z1CD171411 1118F111EI IHI8ELBZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZ
              ZZZZZZZZZZ 1MJZZMJLKL ZKL1ZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZGH HHIGG43FOZ

              111111ED9K 2219L3HGJ1 1Z1ZZMONMH ZZOMSQLM8Z 11411

(Notice that spaces are permitted in the categories data, and that the values
can extend across multiple lines.  However, this means that extra values are
not permitted.)

In order to generate output compatible with PHYLIP dnaml v3.3, this should be
the first option added (so that the categories data are inserted immediately
before the sequence data).


CATEGORIES_FILE (Y)

  Format:  categories_file

Adds the Y option to the input data for the DNArates program.  Makes the program write a file of weights and categories that can be directly added to the input
for the fastDNAml program (see weights_categories script).

  Example: categories_file <archaea.phylip | n_categories 17 | \
           usertree archaea.tree | DNArates

This command line will find the site-specific rates for the sequence data in
archaea.phylip and the tree in archaea.tree, categorize them into 17 groups,
and write the resulting categories (and a weighting mask removing sites of
undetermined rates) into a file called weight_rate.PID, where PID is a number
(the ID of the process running DNArates).

FREQUENCIES (F)

  Format:  frequencies
  Example: frequencies <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml

Adds empirical frequencies option (F) to the input stream.


GLOBAL (G)

  Format:  global [final_tree_rearrangements [partial_tree_rearrangements]]
  Example: global <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml
  Example: global 4 <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml
  Example: global 0 0 <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml

Adds a global option to the input.  If a rearrangement distance is
specified, then this value is added as part of the option auxiliary
information.  In this latter case, it is essential that the input contain
(or the global command be preceded by) a B, J or T option.

  Example: global <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml
  Example: transition 2.0 <archaea.phylip | global 4 | fastDNAml
  Example: transition 2.0 <archaea.phylip | global 0 0 | fastDNAml

The first example invokes the global rearrangement option for the completed
tree, exactly as with DNAML in the PHYLIP package.  The second example performs
"regional" rearrangements of the completed tree, such that subtrees are moved
across as many as tree branch points before being reconnected.  The final
example does not perform any tree rearrangements whatsoever, it just builds a
tree by sequentially adding each of the sequences.  Notice that in the last
two examples, the T 2.0 option is added to the input BEFORE the global option.


JUMBLE (J)

  Format:  jumble [random_seed]
  Example: jumble <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml
  Example: jumble 137 <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml

Adds a jumble option and a random number seed to the input.  If the random
seed is not supplied, then the process id of the jumble shell is used.  Thus,
in the first example, the seed used is the process ID of the jumble shell
script.  Repeated executions of the command line will tend to get different
random number seeds, and hence different addition orders.  In the second
example, the seed is 137.


MIN_INFO (M)

  Format:  min_info  minimum_unambiguous_residues

  Example: categories_file <archaea.phylip | n_categories 17 | \
           usertree archaea.tree | min_info 8 | DNArates

Adds the minimum information option and an auxiliary data line to the input
for the DNArates program.  This changes the threshold value of unambiguous
residues that must be present in a column before the program will consider the
rate to be "defined".  The default value is currently 4.


N_CATEGORIES

  Format:  n_categories  number

  Example: categories_file <archaea.phylip | n_categories 17 | \
           usertree archaea.tree | min_info 8 | DNArates

Adds the C options and an auxiliary data line of the form "C number" to the
input.  When the DNArates program categorizes the rates that it infers for
the sites in the alignment, this is the number of categories it will use.


OUTGROUP (O)

  Format:  outgroup  outgroup_number
  Example: outgroup 5 <archaea.phylip | treefile | fastDNAml > archaea.out

Adds the outgroup option and appropriate auxiliary data line to the input.  The
example will infer a tree for the archaea data, root it on sequence 5, and
write a tree to treefile.PID, where PID is a number (the process ID of
fastDNAml).  The textual output from fastDNAml (a description of the analysis)
is written to archaea.out.


PRINTDATA (1)

  Format:  printdata
  Example: printdata <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml > archaea.out

Adds a printdata option to the input.  In the example, the file archaea.out
will include an echoing of the data in addition to the usual output.


QUICKADD (Q)

  Format:  quickadd
  Example: quickadd <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml > archaea.out

Adds a quickadd option to the input.  This greatly decreases the time in
initially placing a new sequence in the growing tree (but does not change the
time required to subsequently test rearrangements).  This will probably become
the default program behavior in the near future.

Any possible downside of the quickadd option would be a decreased frequency of
finding the globally optimal tree.  Since you should NEVER depend on a single
order of addition yielding the best tree, multiple jumble runs will still be
the best way to check the reproducibility of any presumptively optimal tree.
Quickadd should let you do this more quickly!


RESTART (R)

  Format:  restart  checkpoint_file_name
  Example: quickadd <archaea.phylip | restart checkpoint.13728 | fastDNAml

Adds a restart option and appends the last tree in the checkpoint file to the
input.  This conflicts with a usertree option.  Note that this script makes a
valiant attempt to figure out the beginning location of the last tree in the
file.  In particular, you should not modify lines in the checkpoint file (or
any other treefile that you supply) so that they end with a semicolon or a
period (other than the final line of a tree).  The example will continue
building a tree for the archaea.phylip data from whereever the checkpoint
file left off.


TRANSITION-TRANSVERSION RATIO (T)

  Format:  transition  ratio_value
  Example: transition 2.0 <archaea.phylip | global 4 | fastDNAml

Adds the transition-transversion option and appropriate auxiliary data line
to the input.  This option with a value of 2.0 (the program's default value)
can be used before a global or treefile option with auxiliary data (see the
example).


TREEFILE (Y)

  Format:  treefile  [format_number]

Adds the treefile option, and, if requested, the treefile format auxiliary
data line to the input data.  In this latter case, it is essential that the
input contain (or the treefile command be preceded by) a B, J or T option.
The only formats at present are 1 (default Newick format) and 2 (a prolog
phylip_tree fact).

  Example: outgroup 5 <archaea.phylip | treefile | fastDNAml > archaea.out
  Example: transition 2.0 <archaea.phylip | treefile 2 | fastDNAml

The first example will infer a tree for the archaea data, root it on sequence
5, and write a tree to treefile.PID, where PID is a number (the process ID of
fastDNAml).  The second example writes a prolog fact for the tree inferred from
these same data.  The transition/transversion ratio is supplied with its
default value, only so that the treefile format will be found in the input file.


USERLENGTHS (L)

  Format:  userlengths
  Example: usertree archaea.tree <archaea.phylip | userlengths | fastDNAml

Adds the userlengths option to the input.  This must be used in conjunction
with the usertree option, so it is usually easier to add the second parameter
to the usertree script (see below).  This script is useful if the usertree is
already part of the input, and you only need to alter the lengths option.


USERTREE (U)

  Format: usertree  tree_file [ L ]

Adds the usertree option and appends the tree count and all of the trees in
the named file to the input.  If the L parameter is included, it is added to
the options line to invoke the program userlengths option.

  Example: usertree archaea.tree <archaea.phylip | userlengths | fastDNAml
  Example  usertree archaea.tree L <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml

These two examples are equivalent.

All of the trees in the file are added, so this is not an appropriate way to
evaluate the last tree in a checkpoint file.  Restart is the script to use for
that latter task.


WEIGHTS (W)

  Format:  weights  weight_data_file
  Example: weights  archaea.weight <archaea.phylip | fastDNAml

Adds the weights option (W) and the corresponding data to the input.  The data
must have the format specified for PHYLIP dnaml 3.3.  The first line must be
the word Weights and AT LEAST 3 BLANK SPACES, followed by one weight value per
sequence position.  The weights 0 - 35 are represented by the series 0, 1, 2,
3, ..., 8, 9, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z.  These latter data can be on one or more
lines.  For example,

  Weights     111111111111001100000100011111100000000000000110000110000000
              111101111111111111111111011100000111001011100000000011


WEIGHTS and CATEGORIES (W C)

  Format: weights_categories  weight_and_category_data_file

Adds both the userweights and categories options to the input, along with the
weights and categories data in the named file.  This is useful for importing
the data from the DNArates program into fastDNAml.  The format of the data
file should conform to that of weights auxiliary data followed by categories
auxiliary data.  As noted for the categories option above, in order to
generate output compatible with PHYLIP dnaml, this should be the first option
added (so that the categories data are inserted immediately before the
sequence data).




              SCRIPTS THAT PERFORM OTHER USEFUL FUNCTIONS



clean_checkpoints

Usage:  clean_checkpoints

Locates checkpoint files for which there is a corresponding treefile, and
deletes the former.  This is useful in cleaning up the directory when the
treefile option is in use.



clean_jumbles

Usage:  clean_jumbles  [ -nosummary ]  file_name_root

Finds all files with the form "file_name_root.PID", where PID is the process
ID appended by fastDNAml_boot and fastDNAml_loop to results from analyses with
different jumble seeds.  Unless the nosummary flag is included, all likelihoods
are summarized in a file named "file_name_root.summary".  The likelihoods are
screened for the best value.  An output file with the optimal score is renamed
to "file_name_root.out", and the corresponding treefile (if any) is renamed
"file_name_root.tree".  All other treefiles and output files matching the name
are deleted.  Corresponding checkpoint files are also deleted.



fastDNAml_boot

Usage:  fastDNAml_boot [-seed seed]  [-boots nboot] \
                       [-max maxjumble]  [-nice nicevalue]  [-noclean] \
                       in_file  n_best  [ "dnaml_opt1 [ | dnaml_opt2 ... ]" ]

For the current bootstrap seed, the sequence input order is jumbled (up to
maxjumble times) until the same best tree is found n_best times.  The output
files are then reduced to a summary of the scores produced by jumbling, and one
example of the best tree.  The number process is then repeated with new
bootstrap seeds until nboot samples have been analyzed.

Boot, jumble, treefile and quickadd are included by the script and should not
be specified by the user or in the data file.  Additional fastDNAml
program options are enclosed in quotes, and separated by vertical bars (|).

Flags and parameters:

  in_file         -- name of the input data file
  n_best          -- input order is jumbled (up to maxjumble times) until
                     same tree is found n_best times
  -boots nboot    -- number of different bootstrap samples (Default=1)
  -seed seed      -- seed for first bootstrap (Default is based on the process
                     ID and time of day)
  -max maxjumble  -- maximum attempts at replicating inferred tree
                     (Default=10)
  -nice nicevalue -- run fastDNAml with specified nice value (Default=10)
  -noclean        -- inhibits cleanup of the output files for the individual
                     seeds

Example:

  fastDNAml_boot -boots 100 -seed 137 -max 8 -nice 20  test_data.phylip  2



fastDNAml_loop

Usage:  fastDNAml_loop [-max maxjumble]  [-nice nicevalue]  [-noclean] \
                       in_file  n_best  [ "dnaml_opt1 [ | dnaml_opt2 ... ]" ]

For the given input file, the sequence input order is jumbled (up to maxjumble
times) until the same best tree is found n_best times.  The output files are
then reduced to a summary of the scores produced by jumbling, and one example
of the best tree.

Jumble, treefile and quickadd are included by the script and should not
be specified by the user or in the data file.  Additional fastDNAml
program options are enclosed in quotes, and separated by vertical bars (|).

Flags and parameters:

  in_file         -- name of the input data file
  n_best          -- input order is jumbled (up to maxjumble times) until
                     same tree is found n_best times
  -max maxjumble  -- maximum attempts at replicating inferred tree
                     (Default=10)
  -nice nicevalue -- run fastDNAml with specified nice value (Default=10)
  -noclean        -- inhibits cleanup of the output files for the individual
                     seeds

Example:

  fastDNAml_loop -max 15 -nice 20  test_data.phylip  3



out.PID

Usage:  out.PID  program  outfile
   or   out.PID  -o outfile  program  program_args

When a process sends its output to standard out, this script puts it in a
file whose name is the outfile.PID, where outfile is the name given by the
user and PID is the process ID of the running program.  This is useful when
a program is run a number of times, and output needs to be put in different
files.  Since the fastDNAml program uses the PID in generating the checkpoint
file name and the tree file name, it is useful to be able to put the program
output itself in a file with the corresponding suffix.



scores

Usage:  scores  files

Extracts and sorts likelihood values from fastDNAml output files.  The
corresponding file names are also provided.



trees2NEXUS

Usage:  trees2NEXUS  [ treefile ... ]

Concatenate Newick format trees from named file(s) or from standard input
into a single file suitable for the PAUP (tested) or MacClade (untested)
programs.  For example, it is possible to combine trees from bootstrap
replicates in order to use the PAUP concensus tree functions.



trees2prolog

Usage:  trees2prolog  [ treefile ... ]

Accepts Newick format trees from named file(s) or from standard input and
as converts them to prolog facts of the form pseudoNewick(Comment, Tree).
Each tree must be entirely on one line, and they must be similar to the
form produced by the fastDNAml program.  In particular, the only permitted
comment is one preceeding the whole tree.  If there is no leading commment,
then the fact produced will have arity 1.

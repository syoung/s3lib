Hi Stuart,

I've been communicating with the interproscan support staff in the  
hopes of getting an HOWTO up at the http://gridengine.info wiki site  
- no word on that yet but the word from their support person is that  
they are aware of SGE, have people using SGE and (perhaps) they have  
SGE integration documents or files already in their current release.

The most recent info I can find that does not come from the  
interproscan developers is covered here:

INTERPROSCAN

Dear all,


Well, it looks like we've got Interpro running on the cluster with the 
Sun Grid Engine queuing system.


Steps needed to make this work (technical details):

1 - Allow job submission from all nodes (!)
2 - Update qstat_ipr.pl in the iprscan/bin directory (the patch from 
interpro should work, basically-you need to use the -f flag for qstat).
3 - Create a symbolic link to iprscan/conf/sge6.env under 
iprscan/conf/sge.env
3 - Change the following line in iprscan/sge6/conf

asyncsub=qsub -N [%jobid] [%optqueue] -shell n -b y -o /dev/null -e 
/dev/null [%env IPRSCAN_HOME]/conf/sge6-test.sh [%toolcmd]

To this:
asyncsub=qsub -N [%jobid] [%optqueue] -shell n -b y -o /dev/null -e 
/dev/null [%toolcmd]

Best regards,
Michael Gang
Evogene Bioinformatics

P.S. I would like to specially thank Mr. Powers for his great help



*** [Bioclusters] running interpro at all

Before tackling interpro over sge6 I tried a single host install.

When interpro sets itself up it creates a file in  conf/localenv.sh
When a job is submitted this becomes <jobname>.dsub

It tries unsuccessfully to use a local command instead of rsh
 when we would be rsh-ing back the the same host.
To fix this bug and some limitations, change the file to:


#!/bin/sh
rhost=[%host.exec]
ihost=`hostname`
echo "[%toolexitcode]"

case $rhost in
    ''|localhost|$ihost*)
            [%cmd] ;;
    *)
            rsh $rhost "[%cmd]";;
esac
exit 0


Explanation:
Without a dollars sign on  "ihost"  it will always use rsh.
If you make the test string      case $rhost in   ''|localhost|$ihost*)
 it allows   host.exec   to be empty or localhost.
This allows a non-host-specific install,
 so you can just duplicate it across your cluster
 without having to run the install separately for each node.

Questions about InterPro integration on SGE systems seem to come up fairly frequently. I thought there was a HOWTO or wiki document somewhere but I can't seem to find it now.
Recently though, Michael Gang made the following post to the bioclusters mailing list that covers the steps he needed to perform:

    "... Steps needed to make this work (technical details):

    1 - Allow job submission from all nodes (!)
    2 - Update qstat_ipr.pl in the iprscan/bin directory (the patch from interpro should work, basically-you need to use the -f flag for qstat).
    3 - Create a symbolic link to iprscan/conf/sge6.env under iprscan/conf/sge.env
    3 - Change the following line in iprscan/sge6/conf

*** [Bioclusters] Questions about setting up InterProScan on clusters

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to post a quick message to the mailing list to firstly apologise if there have been 
any problems with setting up InterProScan on your clusters - unfortunately, we only have LSF 
in-house and we therefore can't test on other systems like SGE or PBS.  However, I always try to 
hazard a guess when we get questions about those systems. Specifically, the SGE configuration files 
themselves were re-written for SGE6 by me having remote access to a user's installation (thank you 
Jenny!) although I soon discovered that that installation had its own quirks which were not standard 
for other systems.

The fact that you guys are here supporting each other when installing the software on these atypical 
(to EBI, anyway) set-ups is a great help - particularly because we only have a limited number of 
people who can answer support emails (i.e. mainly me).

I just want to reiterate that if you have any questions about setting InterProScan on your local 
clusters, please email support (at) ebi.ac.uk or interhelp (at) ebi.ac.uk.  If you don't get a reply 
within a couple of days, hassle us again :-)

At the same time, it would be nice to encourage the development of a community of InterProScan users 
who have the program installed on different clusters, so that if anyone has a question about a 
queue-specific issue, the community could be consulted and alterations tested, rather than relying 
on our limited resources at EBI.  What do people think about this?

Sorry if you emailed and didn't get a satisfactory response.  And thanks for all the hard work you 
have evidentially put in in order to get InterProScan working.

Best regards,

Sarah Hunter

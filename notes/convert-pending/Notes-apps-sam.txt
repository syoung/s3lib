ABOUT SAM
==============================

SAM is a data management system to organize, analyze and visualize Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS), Whole Genome Assembly (WGA) and Genome annotation data flow.  
Additional information on SAM and how it could be useful to you can be found here: ./SAM/docs/slides


REQUIREMENTS:
==============================

linux-gnu (i686) /clock 2.4Ghz (the faster, the better) / RAM 512k. The System requirements will change with the size of the WGS project. 
Never tested on PC, but since it uses programs and algorithms developed for and running on unix machines, SAM will not run optimally on PCs.
 
perl, version 5.005_03 built for i686-linux or higher (You may need more recent libraries in some cases)
MySQL Ver 10.8 Distrib 3.23.21-beta, for pc-linux-gnu (i686) or higher
Mozilla, Windows Internet Explorer, etc (anything except Netscape)


OPTIONAL, BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:

RBSfinder (TIGR) ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/software/RBSfinder/
Bioperl http://bioperl.org/


INSTALL:
==============================

1) Unzip and Untar SAM.tar.gz:
------------------------------
gunzip SAM.tar.gz
tar -xvf SAM.tar


2) Modify the shebang line to the full path of your perl interpreter for ALL perl scripts locate here: ./SAM/bin/*.pl
------------------------------
Repeat in ./SAM/cgi-bin/*.pl


3) Many scripts are caching data structures.  You will have to change the lines where the full path of the cache is specified for the following scripts and modules:
------------------------------

CHANGED CACHE DIRECTORY IN SEVERAL .pl FILES 
FROM
/home/tmp/rwarren

TO
/tmp/sam-cache.



./SAM/bin/

DumpSequencesNmakeBlastDB.pl:                     cache_root=>"/home/tmp/rwarren",
import_assembly.pl:                     cache_root=>"/home/tmp/rwarren",
run_assembler.pl:                     cache_root=>"/home/tmp/rwarren",
run_glimmerGene.pl:                     cache_root=>"/home/tmp/rwarren",
run_glimmerGeneRBS.pl:                     cache_root=>"/home/tmp/rwarren",
run_glimmer.pl:                     cache_root=>"/home/tmp/rwarren",
SAMauto_annotate.pl:                     cache_root=>"/home/tmp/rwarren",

./SAM/lib/

wgsDATA.pm:                     cache_root=>"/home/tmp/rwarren",

*The cache object definition is always on top on the script/module

The cache_root is the location in the filesystem that will hold the root of the cache.  Defaults to the 'FileCache' under the OS default temp directory ( often '/tmp' on UNIXes )
unless explicitly set.  You can use ./SAM/tmp to cache data structure or any other directories with read/write permission for the user 'nobody' (web user)
The duration of the cache is variable depending on the type of information, but set to expires after 1,000-1,500 seconds in most of the above scripts.

4) Changing the path of SAM libraries for sam.pl
------------------------------

CHANGED PATH OF USE lib IN cgi-bin/sam.pl
FROM
/home/rwarren/Production/SAM/lib

TO
/home/syoung/base/apps/sam/lib


./SAM/cgi-bin/sam.pl uses libraries to encode data (Cipher.pm), query SAMdb, generate graphs, format the data (wgsDATA.pm) and generate HTML (wgsHTML.pm)
You MUST change the use lib "/home/rwarren/Production/SAM/lib";  to reflect the location of these libraries on your system.


5) Changing the path of Bioperl libraries for BlastParser.pl
------------------------------

INSTALLED BioPerl v1.4 TO /home/syoung/base/apps/sam/bioperl:

cd /home/syoung/base/apps/sam/bioperl

perl Makefile.PL  LIB=/home/syoung/base/apps/sam/bioperl
make
make test
make install

(FOR DETAILS SEE Notes-apps-sam-bioperl.txt)



CHANGED PATH OF BioPerl IN bin/BlastParser.pl
FROM

/home/rwarren/Production/SAM/lib

TO
/home/syoung/base/apps/sam/bioperl



./SAM/bin/BlastParser.pl uses the BPlite module from the Bioperl distribution.  Make sure you change the path of this library in this script.


6) Setting up SAM web pages
------------------------------


6.1. create a new directory in /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/gc/Project_Name or the location of your web server

sudo mkdir /var/www/cgi-bin/sam

6.2. copy sam.pl and nph-Blast_Server.html from ./SAM/cgi-bin/

sudo cp /home/syoung/base/apps/sam/cgi-bin/sam.pl /var/www/cgi-bin/sam
sudo cp /home/syoung/base/apps/sam/cgi-bin/nph-Blast_Server.html /var/www/cgi-bin/sam

INSTALLED DEPENDENCIES FOR sam.pl USING CPAN:

    Date::Manip 
    Text::Cipher


TEST sam.pl:

cd /var/www/cgi-bin/sam
./sam.pl

Can't locate Cipher.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /home/syoung/base/apps/sam/lib /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.5/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.5 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.7/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.6/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.5/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.7 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.6 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.5 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8 .) at /var/www/cgi-bin/sam/sam.pl line 27.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /var/www/cgi-bin/sam/sam.pl line 27.


*** CHECK HOW TO DISABLE SELINUX ON COMMAND LINE ***


6.3. create an htdocs dir with the same name and copy ./SAM/web_images/*  AND ./SAM/javascript/*  to the htdocs/ssl/gc/Project_Name dir

sudo mkdir -p /var/www/htdocs/ssl/sam 
sudo cp /home/syoung/base/apps/sam/web_images/* /var/www/htdocs/ssl/sam 
sudo cp /home/syoung/base/apps/sam/javascript/* /var/www/htdocs/ssl/sam 


ll /var/www

drwxr-xr-x  3 apache    users 4096 Jul  7 22:41 cgi-bin
drwxr-xr-x  3 root      root  4096 Feb  5 14:59 error
drwxr-xr-x  3 root      root  4096 Jul  7 22:50 htdocs
drwxr-xr-x  2 root      root  4096 Aug  6  2007 html
drwxr-xr-x  3 root      root  4096 Feb  5 14:59 icons
drwxr-xr-x 14 root      root  4096 Feb  5 15:00 manual
drwxr-xr-x  2 webalizer root  4096 Feb  5 14:59 usage


chown -R apache:users html
chown -R apache:users htdocs
chown -R apache:users icons 


6.4. make a report directory and ask the webmaster to make it viewable by users using the https protocol



6.5. The wgsHTML.pm also makes use of a style sheet to format text, tables, etc displayed on the web (./SAM/site-style/common.css) and you may want to make use of it.


6.6. create 2 files in your cgi-bin directory with the following names:

userinfo.txt
   content: username;password;assemblydb;host;sequencedb;host;project_id
   These are login credential for MySQL-SAMdb.  It is a good idea to have a login name with read-only privileges for this. 
   e.g. viewer;viewer;WGSdrosophila;

config.txt
   content: htdocs dir for those perl scripts located in the corresponding cgi-bin
   e.g. http://rwweb.bcgsc.bc.ca/intranet/drosophila


6.7. edit ./SAM/cgi-bin/nph-Blast_Server.html and change the directory of the wuBLAST and blast servers




    ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    
    -create a new directory in /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/gc/Project_Name or the location of your web server
    -copy sam.pl and nph-Blast_Server.html from ./SAM/cgi-bin/
    -create an htdocs dir with the same name and copy ./SAM/web_images/*  AND ./SAM/javascript/*  to the htdocs/ssl/gc/Project_Name dir
    -make a report directory and ask the webmaster to make it viewable by users using the https protocol
    
    The wgsHTML.pm also makes use of a style sheet to format text, tables, etc displayed on the web (./SAM/site-style/common.css) and you may want to make use of it.
    
    -create 2 files in your cgi-bin directory with the following names:
    userinfo.txt
       content: username;password;assemblydb;host;sequencedb;host;project_id
       These are login credential for MySQL-SAMdb.  It is a good idea to have a login name with read-only privileges for this. 
       e.g. viewer;viewer;WGSdrosophila;
    
    config.txt
       content: htdocs dir for those perl scripts located in the corresponding cgi-bin
       e.g. http://rwweb.bcgsc.bc.ca/intranet/drosophila
    
    
    **You will have to edit ./SAM/cgi-bin/nph-Blast_Server.html
    and change the directory of the wuBLAST and blast servers
  
  
    

7) Build a SAMdb MySQL database 
------------------------------

*YOU MUST HAVE MySQL PRIVILEGES TO CREATE, EDIT, ALTER, UPDATE, DROP SAMdb in order to use SAM.

after creating a SAMdb database on mysql_server, import the structure::: 

Structure:

`mysql -h mysql_server -u me -D SAMdb(or any name you want) -p < ./SAM/SAMdb/SAMdb.sql`


Configuration Data:

`mysql -h mysql_server -u me -D SAMdb(or any name you want) -p < ./SAM/SAMdb/fill_config_example.sql;

./SAM/SAMdb/fill_config_example.sql contains examples of config data set for our system and projects.

*For SAM to function properly, you will have to go through the configuration tables (Assembler, Blastable, Blast_Config, Config, Center, Enzyme, Executable, Gene_Finder, Node, Project) and change the directories, full path to executable, names, etc. to reflect your systems and project profile.  

*It is important to note that once everything is set the way you want, SAM will create 'project directories' under the following field if its sees that project for the first time:

TABLE: Config FIELD: Config_Data_Dir

The 'project directory' will be created using the following field:

TABLE: Project FIELD: Project_Name

<entry [Mon Apr 20 01:16:56 EDT 2009] MESSAGE EVELYN: AQWA CHALLENGE GRANT BUDGET>




Hi Evelyn,

Here’s the info for the Aqwa challenge grant budget.

Cheers,

Stuart.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Integrated NextGen workflow tool and genomic viewer.

Short abstract:

NextGen sequencing technologies are fast approaching the ‘$1,000 genome’ target, hastening the shift to a new paradigm of correlated and rapid analysis of individual genomic variation, methylation, histone-binding, expression analysis and other genome-wide factors. Bioinformatics infrastructure – hardware, software and personnel – is the bottleneck in the development of this new paradigm. To meet this need, we propose the rapid deployment of a software system and analysis tools for managing NextGen sequencing projects, from short read generation and bioinformatics analysis to data visualization. The system will meet the following challenges: 1) facilitating the analysis of large-scale sequencing studies, 2) enabling transcriptome and genetic network analyses, and 3) determination of the relationship of sequence variation and phenotypes to disease. The proposed study will involve carrying out an objective evaluation of current NextGen assemblers/aligners for each of the three main NextGen sequence platforms (Illumina/Solexa, Roche/454 and ABI/SOLiD) and implementing pre-optimized variation annotation, expression analysis and network analysis workflows. The tool will also allow users to create their own customized workflows and to view the results using real-time visualization of huge genomic data sets.

Hi Joel,

Here are the CPU usage stats attached. The Excel sheets are as follows:

1. Current CPU usage based on current base pair yield per run on the Solexa GAII (MIHG)

I put in $0.20 as the hourly CPU cost but you can fill in the right amount.

2. CPU usage based on vendor estimates by end 2009

    Illumina, ABI Say GAII, SOLiD 3 Will Yield 100-Gb Runs, $10K Human Genome by End of Year

    http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/illumina-abi-say-gaii-solid-3-will-yield-100-gb-runs-10k-human-genome-end-year?page=show

3. Assembly times for the main four applications (Eland, MAQ, Mira, Velvet)

One important point to note is that Eland can use multiple CPUs but can only align approximately 16.7 million sequences at one time whereas the other assemblers cannot use multiple CPUs so they have to be split into batch jobs. Running these batch jobs in parallel on a cluster rather than in serial on a single host saves a considerable amount of time.

4. Assembler specifications

The table shows the different limits of the various assemblers and demonstrates why it is necessary to use many different assemblers.

5. Disk usage - estimates for Solexa and SOLiD

These are rough estimates - you might want to check with Warner for the most recent file sizes with the longer read runs.

I hope that's useful. I didn't do the comparison of 1 CPU versus 8 CPUs for Eland but the Assembly times table will hopefully explain the necessity of running the assemblies on the cluster. Let me know if you need any more.


I've attached a copy of my latest draft of the Aqwa challenge grant application. Could you please give me these hardware costs for the grant?

1. 8-node (8-core each) cluster 
2. HPC cluster costs (CPU/hour)
3. Production server
4. Development server

Cheers,

Stuart.

...
This change in the principle of cluster detection, which will be part of an upcoming analysis pipeline upgrade to version 1.4, also increases the accuracy of the data, both for the first and the second read of a paired-end run, according to Bentley.
...


1. WHICH APPS CAN USE MULTIPLE CPUs

MAQ
http://maq.sourceforge.net/maq-man.shtml

The MAQ (Mapping and Assembly with Quality) assembler is a workflow of several applications: 

1. Convert the reference sequences to the binary fasta format
maq fasta2bfa ref.fasta ref.bfa

2. Convert the reads to the binary fastq format
maq fastq2bfq reads.fastq reads-1.bfq

3. Align the reads to the reference
maq match reads-1.map ref.bfa reads-1.bfq

4. Statistics from the alignment
maq mapcheck ref.bfa reads-1.map >mapcheck.txt

5. Build the mapping assembly
maq assemble consensus.cns ref.bfa reads-1.map 2>assemble.log

6. Extract consensus sequences and qualities
maq cns2fq consensus.cns >cns.fq

7. Extract list of SNPs
maq cns2snp consensus.cns >cns.snp

Parallelizing the alignment stage (step 3) is required for large amounts of data.

MAQ can align 162 Mbp of Solexa short reads against the human cDNA reference sequence in approximately 58 minutes. Assuming the algorithm can accomodate Scaling up to 



2. ELAND 1 CPU VS 8 CPUs

Scales nicely.


3. PARALLEL VS SERIAL

The reference aligners MAQ and Eland take approximately the same amount of time to align 162 Mbp of short reads against the human cDNA reference sequence. The de novo assembler Velvet is within the same order of magnitude whereas the reference aligner Mira takes roughly 30X longer.

Project Description:
Re-sequencing of whole human genomes posses difficult computational challenges. We propose to use AWS/EC2 and Maq—on data from Bentley et al. (2008), http://www.illumina.com/HumanGenome/ - to demonstrate a whole genome resequencing pipeline. We will leverage our relationship with Illumina to make use of an unpublished assembly, still under review at NCBI, to validate our pipeline.

The proposed MAQ pipeline will include:

    * - Upload the African genome reads (SRA000271) by use of FTP.
    * - Upload the reference genome
    * - The following jobs will be run:
          o * Placing: place the reads against the reference genome with up to 3 mismatches
          o * Sorting: sort the placed reads into bins of 1,000,000 contiguous locations
          o * Assembly: assemble the reads in each bin, and generate snps
          o * Filter: filter the snps
    * - Make the result available for FTP download

Some development work will be required to port the MAQ pipeline to AWS/EC2. The expected resources consumed will include EC2 CPU cost and EC2 transfer cost. CPU usage is expected to be 36000 CPU hours, based on the previous run on the Harvard cluster. At approximately $0.20 per CPU hour, this represents a cost of about $7300. Transfer costs will include transfer of about 150GB, which at $0.1/GB represents a cost of $15. Depending on memory usage, high-CPU EC2 instances could be used to halve the cost. An assembly that tolerates fewer mismatches will also drop costs dramatically.

The introduction of new methods for DNA sequencing has opened new avenues, including large-scale sequencing studies, metagenomics, transcriptomics, genetic network analysis, and determination of the relationship of sequence variation and phenotypes to disease, to address heretofore unapproachable problems in biomedical research. However, since the large amounts (terabases) of data generated overwhelm existing computational resources and analytic methods, urgent action is needed to enable the translation of this rich new source of genomic information into medical benefit.

06-CA-112 Development of high throughput mechanisms for genomic analysis.
This includes methods to improve the throughput of next gen methods for genomic analysis. Methods could be either laboratory based or bioinformatics based improvements with the goal of decreasing the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample.

The current estimate of sequencing an entire human genome is $5000 and can be accomplished in a few months. However, current bioinformatic and analytic capabilities are inadequate to analyze the volumes of data that would be generated by deep sequencing many individuals. Specifically, RC1 applications are sought to (1) optimize base calls from next-generation sequencing machines, (2) develop and improve optimal alignment/mapping methods that tackle uncertainty and multiple potential placements, (3) identify methods for SNP calling from multiple reads and multiple samples, (4) identify copy-number variation calling from next-generation sequencing data, and (5) develop automated methods for searching sequence databases that could be used to give probabilities that a variant is real.

06-AA-104	Systems Biology Approach for the Characterization of Immune Function.  Research is encouraged that takes a systems biology approach to study the effects of alcohol on immune function, by measuring a panel of immune effectors.  Such an approach includes quantitative profiling and validation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, (cell surface and secreted) and neuroendocrine hormones at different stages of liver disease or immune function impairment using analytical techniques with multiplex capability.  The goal is to provide bases for diagnostic biomarkers and for designing intervention strategies.  This approach also pertains to the combination of alcohol and infection with HCV or HIV/HCV.

06-AR-102	Systems Biology for Musculoskeletal System Development, Function and Diseases.  Methodology is needed for integrated analysis of disease mechanisms in humans, combining GWAS, gene expression, microRNA, epigenetics studies, immunologic profiles and disease phenotype using existing databases. The goal is a better understanding of the regulatory networks involved in maintaining normal musculoskeletal tissues structure and function and the changes in these networks that correlate with musculoskeletal disease.  Studies of gene expression, protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-protein, interactions and of regulatory micro-RNA have generated enormous amounts of relationship data (i.e., who controls whom).  These data are being systematically curated to create computable databases by academic and commercial enterprises (e.g., Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software).  This effort will eventually lead to the construction of a regulatory map.  It is foreseeable that a map of the regulatory networks will provide a powerful tool for understanding all disease processes and for providing a guide for designing more effective therapies. Components include 1) Identify cohorts with valuable clinical and phenotypic data, cell and tissue samples, and existing data sets; 2) Address issues of consent for acquisition and use of resources, including post-mortem; 3) Address issues of data sharing; 4) Establish infrastructure and governance for widely accessible resource of data and analysis tools.

06-AR-103	Systems Biology for Skin and Rheumatic Diseases.   Expansion of Merck’s proposed Integrative Bionetwork Community to include skin biology and diseases and rheumatic diseases. Merck has proposed to make their database of phenotypic data and genetics available to the public. While it is not clear what this database currently contains, in the area of skin biology/diseases and rheumatic diseases, there are already efforts by several NIAMS-supported research groups to identify the genetic basis of several diseases (e.g. psoriasis, vitiligo, and alopecia areata) through GWAS and to link expression data with the genetics. Similar efforts are ongoing in rheumatic diseases. It would be useful to extend the dataset by the addition of genome-wide epigenetics data and a catalogue of microRNAs identified by high throughput sequencing technologies. The data could also be extended through the addition of more diseases as well as the effects of treatment. There may also be some benefit to include stages of skin development and epidermal differentiation. Contact: Dr. Susana Serrate-Sztein, 301-594-5032, NIAMShelp-NIHChallengeGrants@mail.nih.gov


06-EB-109	Model-driven Biomedical Technology Development.  Progress in the development of many biomedical technologies (e.g. neuroengineering technologies, drug and gene delivery systems, tissue engineering) could be greatly accelerated with the development of in silico modeling and simulation methods to drive hypothesis formation, experimental design, data collection, data analysis and synthesis, and re-formulation of the original hypothesis.  In a systematic and robust manner, models should identify the gaps in knowledge and the limitations of the engineering design.  Proposals that encourage the integration and translation of knowledge from in vitro to in vivo systems are being sought. Contact: Dr. Grace Peng, 301-451-4778, pengg@mail.nih.gov

06-EB-112	Large-scale Kinetics of Multiple Signaling Pathways.  Building upon successful efforts in detailed kinetic modeling of highly-complex chemical reactions (e.g., turbulent combustion), large-scale kinetic models of multiple and integrated molecular signaling pathways are sought.  This will help determine under which conditions particular pathways may dominate or interfere, and begin to form a predictive framework as new kinetic data and signaling molecules are identified.  Construction of these models will highlight important kinetic information gaps and pave the way toward ultimately being able to perform in-silico simulations of inflammatory and immune response to new materials and engineered therapies.

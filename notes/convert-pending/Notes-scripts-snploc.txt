Hi Dale/Jake,

Here’s the link to CLC bio’s Genome Workbench:

downloads

Dale: Don’t forget to send me the link to the Aphid genome project (for the better assembly) so I can retry it with Mira and let you know how it goes.

Jake: This is the page for FTPing the data files to me (it’ll email me the link to download them):

File Management System (FMS)
http://it.med.miami.edu/x447.xml

It says you can send files of unlimited size so could you try uploading the SNP rs# data file first? If it’s too slow you could just send me a chunk.

And if you get hold of the probe sequences file please FTP me a copy/send me a link!

Here’s some info on mapping to the University’s network drive:

whether the SNP is in a repeat region; the regions, as identified by the RepeatMasker program, were downloaded in the file chromOut.zip from the UCSC Genome site.

normalized score

You can find more information about the score by looking at one of  the
README files for the chain/net tables on the downloads server.  It looks like
we don't have a directory for the self chain, but you can find an applicable
explanation in one of the other chain/net downloads dirs (such as

>>>...
    The hg16 and mm3 assemblies were aligned by the blastz alignment
    program, which is available from Webb Miller's lab at Penn State
    University (http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/).  Any mm6 sequences larger
    than 10,010,000 bases were split into chunks of 10,010,000 bases overlapping
    by 10,000 bases for alignment.  A similar process was followed for rn3,
    with chunks of 30,000,000 overlapping by 0.  Following alignment, the
    coordinates of the chunk alignments were corrected by the

***     blastz-normalizeLav script written by Scott Schwartz of Penn State.

    Transposons that have been inserted since the Human/Mouse split were
    removed from the assemblies before alignment using the fasta-subseq and
    strip_rpts programs from Penn State.  The abbreviated genomes were aligned
    with blastz, and the transposons were then added back in (i.e. the
    
    The blastz scoring matrix (Q parameter) used was the default matrix:
    
               A    C    G    T
          A   91 -114  -31 -123
          C -114  100 -125  -31
          G  -31 -125  100 -114
          T -123  -31 -114   91
    
    with a gap open penalty of O=400 and a gap extension penalty of E=30.
    The minimum score for an alignment to be kept was K=3000 for the first pass
    and L=2200 for the second pass, which restricted the search space to the
    regions between two alignments found in the first pass.  The minimum
    score for alignments to be interpolated between was H=2000.
    
    The .lav format blastz output, which does not include the sequence, was 
    converted to .axt with lavToAxt and then to .psl format using the axtToPsl
    program. Blastz alignments were chained using the axtChain program. Chained 
    alignments were processed into nets by the chainPreNet, chainNet, netSyntenic, 
    and netClass programs. netToAxt was used to produce .axt files from the .net
    and .chain files using the -maxGap=300 option. 
    The axtTight alignments were processed with subsetAxt using the matrix:
    
             A    C    G    T
        A  100 -200 -100 -200
        C -200  100 -200 -100
        G -100 -200  100 -200
        T -200 -100 -200  100
    
    with a gap open penalty of 2000 and a gap extension penalty of 50.
    The minimum score was 3400.
    All programs run after blastz were written by Jim Kent at UCSC.

    If you plan to download a large file or multiple files from this 
    directory, we recommend you use ftp rather than downloading the files 
    via our website. To do so, ftp to hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu, then go to 
    the directory goldenPath/hg16/vsMm3/. To download multiple 
    files, use the "mget" command:
    
        mget <filename1> <filename2> ...
        - or -
        mget -a (to download all the files in the directory) 
    
    All the tables in this directory are freely available for public use.

Subject: perl script

Hi Stuart,

We have a small Perl script project that I was hoping you could help us with. Basically, we need to write something to query a SNP’s rs# for its sequence location (we’ll have a list of about 1 million snps). We’d next need to cross-reference the location of 50bp of flanking sequence surrounding the SNP with the Self-chain annotation track (available in SQL table) in UCSC. 

We want to flag all the SNPs that are in regions that have homology elsewhere in the genome, and also, for each SNP that is in a region of homology, provide a score for the relative sequence distance between the SNP flank and its nearest paralogue). Depending on what the data look like, there is the possibility of getting a paper out of it. Could we meet sometime this afternoon to discuss this? Jake and I are available from 2-3pm and after 3:30 in the CRB. 


Thanks,
Dale

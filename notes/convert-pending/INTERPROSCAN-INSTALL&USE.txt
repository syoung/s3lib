INTERPROSCAN
************
INSTALL
+++++++
SET THE $ENV{IPRSCAN_HOME} VARIABLE IN MOST FILES TO:

$ENV{IPRSCAN_HOME} ='/Users/young/FUNNYBASE/apps/iprscan'

RUN IPRSCAN
+++++++++++ 
NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE
iprscan -cli -seqtype n -i ../test.nuc.seq  -iprlookup -goterms -o ../test.nuc.out.xml -verbose

PEPTIDE SEQUENCE (DEFAULT)
iprscan -cli -i ../test.seq -iprlookup -goterms -o iprscan.OUTPUT.xml

OPTIONS
+++++++
-seqtype 	n for DNA/RNA, p for PROTEINS
-iprlookup	lookup the corresponding InterPro references to the output
-goterms 	look up the corresponding entries in GO (Gene Ontology)
 
For more options/informations about what iprscan is able to do type:
 ./iprscan -cli -h

NB: -cli option is mandatory for command line usage. It specifies to the script
       that user is using it as command line and not as CGI script.

WHAT IT DOES
++++++++++++
 The program will prepare a temporary directory (something like
 'tmp/20041011/iprscan-20041011-11123456') where:
 iprscan-20041011-11123456 is a the session directory in format:

 iprscan : toolname
 20041011: date of the day (YYYYMMDD)
 
    11123456: time of the day (hhmmssNN) NN=random number

   When the scanning is finished the results will be displayed on the STDOUT
   unless you used the -o option to precise an output file where to put results.
   Anyway the raw file is writen in the session directory. What is displayed on
   on the screen is just a conversion of this raw file.
   To check that everything works correctly you can compare your results with
   the 'merged.xml' file included in the root of the distribution.

   % diff merged.raw tmp/20041011/iprscan-20041011-11123456/merged.raw

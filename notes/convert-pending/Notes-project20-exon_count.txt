<entry [Tues Aug 12 01:09:28 EDT 2008] CREATED compare-reference.pl TO COUNT EXONS IN COMMON BETWEEN TWO ASSEMBLIES ON A REFERENCE BACKBONE>




compare-reference.pl

THIS SCRIPT MAKES THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INPUT DATA:

    -   OVERLAPPING EXONS CAN BE MERGED INTO A SINGLE EXON ENTITY

    -   CONSECUTIVE ALTERNATE TRANSCRIPTS HAVE AT LEAST ONE EXON IN COMMON

./exons-refseq.pl -i /home/syoung/base/pipeline/exons-refseq/refseq-exons.ncbi36.tsv

WHERE THE INPUT FILE refseq-exons.ncbi36.tsv WAS DOWNLOADED FROM UCSC:

http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=111084073&clade=vertebrate&org=Human&db=hg18&hgta_group=genes&hgta_track=refGene&hgta_table=0&hgta_regionType=genome&position=chrX%3A151073054-151383976&hgta_outputType=primaryTable&hgta_outFileName=

RESULTS:

27,017                   ALTERNATE TRANSCRIPTS (RefSeq)
209,369                 UNIQUE EXONS (RefSeq)

This compares to the following counts from the ASTD (Alternate Splicing and Transcript Database):
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/astd/download.html

93,463                   ALTERNATE TRANSCRIPTS (ASTD)
325,693                 UNIQUE EXONS (ASTD)

Hi Stephan,

Here’s the results of the RefSeq unique exon count you wanted urgently:

27,017                   ALTERNATE TRANSCRIPTS (RefSeq)
209,369                 UNIQUE EXONS (RefSeq)

The counts were based on the data download you showed me:
http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=111084073&clade=vertebrate&org=Human&db=hg18&hgta_group=genes&hgta_track=refGene&hgta_table=0&hgta_regionType=genome&position=chrX%3A151073054-151383976&hgta_outputType=primaryTable&hgta_outFileName=

This compares to the following counts from the ASTD (Alternate Splicing and Transcript Database):

93,463                   ALTERNATE TRANSCRIPTS (ASTD)
325,693                 UNIQUE EXONS (ASTD)

These counts were based on this data:
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/astd/download.html

It took a while to complete the exon count because the RefSeq data was a bit messy (exon start/stops differing, exons overlapping, etc.) so the parser needed a lot of testing. 

I’ll do the assembly comparison and try to install ERANGE tomorrow.

Cheers,

Stuart.

Hi Stephan,

Thanks for the list of captured genes. I’ve got to head off now but I’ll email you the count of refseq exons later this evening (the parser is working but I’m triple checking to make sure there are no bugs).

Cheers,

Stuart.

For our in-house capture array we covered the following genes:

DLGAP3
GRIP
RAPGEF4
GRM7

GRM7 is only partly on it.

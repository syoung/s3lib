Hi Andy,

How much memory per node and scratch/permanent disk space do you think you'd need to run your jobs? I'll look into the availability of more resources.

Hi Andy,

I've almost finished a 2-week run of calculations on the cluster but you're welcome to try running some jobs on it. I've probably got about four more days left of this set but you can run test jobs in the meantime and email me when you're ready to do some large-scale crunching.

Your username and password are as before (my earlier message). If you haven't got them, do let me know and I'll send them to you again.

I guess most of your work will be using parallelised software like NWCHEM but if you need to use sun grid engine for batch job submission and control, you can test submitting jobs with:

qsub /common/sge/examples/jobs/simple.sh

which will leave output and error logs in your home directory (/Users/pounds).

You can view the queue with 'qstat -f' or using an updating queue view:

qs

or

qs 5 

where the latter will update the queue view every 5 seconds (default = 10 secs).

Let me know if there's anything you need to know or need me to do.

Cheers,

Stuart.

Hi Andy,

Sorry I've not been in touch sooner. I've been troubleshooting some problems on the cluster and haven't reached a resolution yet. It seems related to the NetInfo database - the user I created for you on the cluster can't log in. I'm working on it with some tech help from Apple's bioteam and hopefully will have it resolved in the next few days.

In the meantime, if you want to just test out GAMESS or NWCHEM on a Mac OSX environment, I've created an account for you on my workstation:

Host: genomics.rsmas.miami.edu
User: pounds
Pass: <Tony's surname> (please change with passwd)

I'll keep you posted about the cluster developments.

<entry [Mon Jan  8 18:09:26 PST 2007] PROBLEM WITH /Users EXPORT FROM gems>



MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE CREATION OF THE pounds USER AND THE PRESENCE OF THE
/Users/pounds FOLDER IN /Users.

ON gems:

showmount -e
Exports list on localhost:
/opt                                Everyone
/Library/Perl                      192.168.2.0 
/Volumes/gemshd4/common            129.171.101.233 node001.cluster.private node002.cluster.private node004.cluster.private node005.cluster.private node006.cluster.private node007.cluster.private node008.cluster.private node009.cluster.private node010.cluster.private node011.cluster.private node012.cluster.private node013.cluster.private node014.cluster.private node015.cluster.private node016.cluster.private

I.E., NO /Volumes/gemshd4/Users EXPORTED!

SO DELETED ALL TRACES OF USER pounds:

1. REMOVE USER pounds
=====================

sudo dscl . delete /users/pounds

CHECK IT WORKED:

sudo nireport . /users name | grep pounds
<NOTHING>

nireport . /users name uid
<NO pounds USER>

2. REMOVE GID FOR pounds
========================
nireport / /groups name gid
>>>...
netboot 120
com.apple.access_all_services   500
pounds  #NoValue#
<<<

CHECK IT WORKED:

sudo dscl . delete /groups/pounds
<NO pounds GROUP>

3. REMOVE THE HOME DIRECTORY FOR pounds
=======================================

sudo rm -fr /Users/pounds

AND REBOOTED

Hi Andy,

I've created a temporary account you can use to access the servers. 

User: pounds
Pass: <Tony's surname>

You'll have to go through this machine:

genomics.rsmas.miami.edu

and then ssh to:

Cheers,

Gaussian is not on the system but it could be loaded if you have a copy.
I've just applied for a NWCHEM licence and GAMESS licence so should be able to download them in a few days time.

I hope that answers all of your questions. If you need to know anything else, just drop me a line.

Btw, how much volume/time were you thinking of using? And what kind of research is it related to?

NOTE:

1. Gaussian
Revision C.02
Gaussian is a computational chemistry package that has become the standard code for fast electronic structure calculations. It is able to utilize shared-memory multi-processor architectures. Gaussian has been developed over the course of several decades by a host of people, and is now distributed by Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh PA.

2. GAMESS
The "General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System" (GAMESS) is a quantum chemistry software package that was assembled from various older codes (in particular, HONDO) by M. Dupuis, D. Spangler, and J. J. Wendoloski of the National Resources for Computations in Chemistry (NRCC). The code has undergone great changes since then and is maintained now by the Ameslab at Iowa State University.
Gamess performs a great many of standard quantum chemical calculations. These include:

         1. RHF, UHF, ROHF, GVB, or MCSCF self-consistent calculations.
         2. CI or MP2 corrections to the energy.
         3. Semi-empirical MNDO, AM1, or PM3 methods.
         4. Analytic energy gradients for SCF, MP2 or CI.
         5. Geometry optimizations, saddle point searches, and vibrational frequencies.
         6. Intrinsic reaction paths, gradient extremal curves, and dynmic reaction coordinates.
         7. Many molecular properties, such as densities, electrostatic potentials, dipole moments, etc.
         8. Modelling of solvent effects and electric fields.

3. NWCHEM
NWChem is a computational chemistry package that is designed to run on high-performance parallel supercomputers as well as conventional workstation clusters. It aims to be scalable both in its ability to treat large problems efficiently, and in its usage of available parallel computing resources. NWChem has been developed by the High-performance Computational Chemistry group of the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

<h2>Using Juniper Network Connect on Ubuntu</h2>

<h2>What is Network Connect?</h2>

<p><em>Network Connect</em> is a software package from Juniper Networks that
interfaces with its <a href="http://www.juniper.net/products_and_services/ssl_vpn_secure_access/">Secure
Access</a> hardware and provides a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution.
There are two software products that connect to Secure Access servers:
<em>Windows Secure Application Manager</em> which, as you might guess, runs on
Microsoft Windows; and <em>Network Connect</em> which runs on other platforms,
in particular GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>So, GNU/Linux is supported!  Great!  Well, sort of.  Juniper has fallen
into the common trap of supporting Red Hat Enterprise Linux and calling it
good enough.  It's quite frustrating, since with an extra hour or two of
effort these companies could create a portable solution.  I realize that
support costs money, but even if they only officially supported Red Hat
Enterprise, it wouldn't hurt them to go the extra couple of centimeters
necessary to provide a more generic implementation.</p>

<p>Luckily, the actual VPN software works fine on Ubuntu; it's the invocation
script and especially the installer that are utterly broken.  However, it's a
relatively straightforward proposition to simply avoid using them; I've
created a shell script which will allow you to connect and disconnect without
needing to go through the broken scripting that comes with Network Connect.
Here's how you use it.</p>

<h2>Making It Work</h2>

<h3>Environmental Requirements</h3>

<p>I have tested this on every Ubuntu release starting with 6.06, up to and
including the current Karmic Koala (9.10) beta release.  I have used on both
32-bit and 64-bit systems.</p>

<p>Although I haven't tried this on Kubuntu, there is support for KDE that
I've put together from suggestions emailed to me, plus information I found in
web documentation.  I haven't tested it myself but hopefully it works.</p>

<p>In fact, there's nothing about this solution that requires Ubuntu per se.
You should be able to use it with little adaptation on almost any GNU/Linux
distribution.</p>

<p>The version of Network Connect I have is:

</p><pre style="margin-left: 4em">$ ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ncsvc --version
Juniper Network Connect Server for Linux.
Version         : 1.2
Release Version : 6.1-0-Build13103
Build Date/time : May  6 2008 21:34:46
Copyright 2001-2008 Juniper Networks
</pre>

<p>I know that some older versions require extra steps (for example, 1.0
versions require the installation of Motif libraries).  I can no longer test
with these older versions so I can't say how well they work.  If you have
versions prior to 1.2 I strongly suggest you request that your IT department
upgrade you to a newer release.</p>

<h3>Package Requirements</h3>

<p>In order to install the package and to run the graphical VPN control
utility, you will need a 32-bit Java runtime environment and a browser plugin.
Personally I need this for other reasons as well and I've been using the Sun
JRE, but I suppose others might work as well.  I've heard that people have
had issues with OpenJDK, but YMMV.</p>

<p>On 32-bit Ubuntu I use:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 4em">sudo aptitude install sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-jre
</pre>

<p>On 64-bit Ubuntu I use the above <em>plus</em> this:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 4em">sudo aptitude install ia32-sun-java6-bin
</pre>

<p>Note that older versions of Ubuntu might not support Java 6; in that case it
works fine to replace <code>java6</code> with <code>java5</code> in the above
package names.</p>

<p>After you install the browser plugin, you'll need to restart FireFox.</p>

<p>A critical aspect of the VPN is that your DNS resolution information is
reset to point to the DNS server of the VPN; this allows you to resolve
internal hostnames that aren't registered outside the VPN.  Usually, when you
exit the VPN tool it will restore your original DNS settings.  However, I have
seen this fail; when that happens your system can no longer resolve any
hostnames.  It seems like the network is broken but it's actually a trivial
fix... if you know what your original DNS server was.  I recommend making a
copy of the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file on your system so you can copy
it back later if necessary.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Install My Script</h3>

<p>I wrote a shell script to simplify the install and invocation of the
Network Connect VPN; using the web interface to connect and the broken install
script is too annoying.</p>

<p>First you need to install my script onto your system:</p>

<font size="+2"><a href="http://mad-scientist.net/junipernc">Download the junipernc script</a></font>

<p>Put it somewhere on your PATH; I typically create <code>~/bin</code> and
add that to my PATH for these sorts of things.  Don't forget to ensure the
script is executable after you download it.</p>

<p>If you didn't understand the previous paragraph, then open up a terminal
(use Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Terminal) and enter these commands; none
of them should give you any error message.  You will need to type your
password when prompted (after the <code>sudo</code> command)</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 4em">wget -q -O /tmp/junipernc http://mad-scientist.net/junipernc
chmod 755 /tmp/junipernc
sudo cp /tmp/junipernc /usr/bin
</pre>

<p></p>

<h3>Step 2: Install Network Connect Software</h3>

<p>The Network Connect software is installed automatically when you first
connect to the server.  Although this install will fail on Ubuntu due to the
fairly stupid scripting Juniper provides, it's still necessary to go through
this step to obtain the software.</p>

<p>So, connect to your Juniper VPN server with FireFox and log into the VPN.
You should have received instructions from your IT department or whomever
manages the server on how to do this.</p>

<p>Once it's done you'll see something like this (maybe after some other
links); Click the "Start" button next to "Network Connect":
<br><img style="margin-left: 4em" src="./Juniper Network Connect on Ubuntu_files/jnc-start.png"></p>

<p>The Network Connect software will download:<br>
<img style="margin-left: 4em" src="./Juniper Network Connect on Ubuntu_files/jnc-download.png"></p>

<p>The software will pop up a terminal window asking for the root password:<br>
<img style="margin-left: 4em" src="./Juniper Network Connect on Ubuntu_files/jnc-terminal.png"></p>

<p>Of course, on Ubuntu root doesn't have a password and the script is not
smart enough to consider using sudo.  So ignore this: hit ENTER and when it
asks if you'd like to try again, hit ENTER again.  You will get an error
message about SSL; click OK.  This will cause the startup to fail, but that's
fine because it's left behind the downloaded software which we can then use
with a more portable installer.</p>

<p>Before continuing, log out from the VPN connection in the browser.  There
should be some kind of exit button on the page.  If you can't find it, exiting
your browser should do it.  We won't be needing it anymore anyway.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Run My Script</h3>

<p>To complete the installation, you should invoke my <code>junipernc</code>
script.  To do this, open a terminal window (Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt;
Terminal) and type <code>junipernc</code>.  Whenever the script runs it checks
to be sure everything is set up and, if not, will do it for you.</p>

<p>The first time you run it, you will need to enter your GNU/Linux account
password to allow root privileges to be assigned to the Network Connect
utility.</p>

<p>Next, you will be asked for a server name; this should be the same server
you browsed to in the previous step.</p>

<p>Next, you will be asked for a user name; enter the username you used to log
into the Juniper connect web site.</p>

<p>Finally, you will be asked for a VPN service realm.  If there is a default
value that is almost certainly the value you should use: the script obtains
this value by querying your server.  If there is no default given you will
need to contact your IT department for help with this.</p>

<p>At this point, the software should be installed and configured.  These
values will be saved and you won't need to go through these steps again.  Now
the script will automatically try to start the VPN, as described in the next
section.</p>

<h3>Startup</h3>

<p>Whenever you run the <code>junipernc</code> script it will prompt you for
your password; my company uses SecurID so we enter a personal PIN plus the
value provided by the SecurID fob.  So, that's what the script asks for.
However if your company uses just a simple password it should work fine to
provide it here as well.</p>

<p>The GUI Network Connect tool will start and you should get a connection.
Yay!!</p>

<p>My company limits the amount of consecutive time you can be connected so I
need to restart my connection every so often.  I arrange for this in my script
by having it detect when the Network Connect applet has exited, and asking if
you want to restart the VPN.  If you say yes, it will ask for your password
information again and restart the VPN.  As long as I'm there when the timeout
happens I can almost always restart the connection without losing any of my
sessions (my server is configured to give me back the same IP address, as
long as someone else didn't take it).</p>

<h3>Command-line Options</h3>

<h4>No-Java Mode</h4>

<p>If you can't get a 32-bit Java installed on your system, or don't want to
install Java for some reason, the <code>junipernc</code> script supports this
although with missing functionality.  Invoking the script with the
<code>-nojava</code> flag will avoid the need for Java at all.  The problem is
you won't have any way to track the status of your connection, including when
it's active or not.  You can use ^C to kill the script, and thus the
connection.</p>

<h4>Non-GUI Mode</h4>

<p>You can run the <code>junipernc</code> script without any GUI at all, by
using the <code>-nogui</code> flag.  This also automatically sets
the <code>-nojava</code> flag.  When set, the script will not use any
graphical dialogs.  As with the <code>-nojava</code> flag, the problem here
is you can't track the status of your connection.  You can ^C the script to
kill the connection.</p>

<h4>Deconfigure</h4>

<p>The script remembers information about your connection such as username and
the security certificate it obtained from your server.  If these are bad (you
typed the wrong username or your server has changed its certificate) you can
delete the configuration by calling <code>junipernc</code> with the
<code>-deconfig</code> option.  This will delete all the configuration but
leave the installed version of Network Connect so you don't have to download
it again.  You can start over with Step 3 above to re-configure.</p>

<h4>Uninstall</h4>

<p>The script also can perform an "uninstall"; invoke it with the
<code>-uninstall</code> option.  This will delete all the configuration AND
the complete installed version of Network Connect.  You'll have to start over
with Step 1 of the installation to re-install.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have a lot to say here.  If things don't work for you
you might try asking on one of the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=232607">Ubuntu forum
threads</a> dedicated to this subject.</p>

<p>If you can't access any network hosts after bringing down the VPN, it's
probably because your DNS server was not reset properly.  You <em>did</em>
take my advice above and make a backup copy, right?  Suppose you called the
backup <code>~/resolv.bak</code>; then you'd run this command to restore your
network:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 4em">$ sudo cp $HOME/resolv.bak /etc/resolv.conf
</pre>

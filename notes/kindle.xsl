You can send documents to your supported Fire & Kindle devices and Kindle reading apps by e-mailing them to your Send-to-Kindle e-mail address. Your Send-to-Kindle e-mail address is a unique address that is assigned to you when you register your compatible Fire tablet, Kindle device, or Kindle reading app.

NOTES
=====


By default, your documents will also be saved in Amazon Cloud Drive. To change this setting, visit the Personal Documents Settings section of the Manage Your Content and Devices page.

Verify that your document is a supported file type. See Supported File Types for Kindle Personal Documents Service.
Attach your document to a new e-mail, or forward an existing e-mail with the document attached, to your Send-to-Kindle e-mail address.
Note: You can view your Send-to-Kindle e-mail address in your Personal Document Settings.

To be delivered successfully, your e-mail cannot contain more than 25 attachments and cannot be sent to more than 15 distinct Send-to-Kindle e-mail addresses. The total size of your documents must be less 50 MB or less before they need to be compressed in a ZIP file.

Tip: Typing "convert" in the subject of the e-mail converts your document to Kindle format before delivering it to your devices and Amazon Cloud Drive. ZIP files are automatically opened by the conversion service, converted to Kindle format, and are stored in your content library.

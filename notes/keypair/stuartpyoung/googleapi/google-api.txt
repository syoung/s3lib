API Access

To prevent abuse, Google places limits on API requests. Using a valid OAuth token or API key allows you to exceed anonymous limits by connecting requests back to your project.

Authorized API Access

OAuth 2.0 allows users to share specific data with you (for example, contact lists) while keeping their usernames, passwords, and other information private. A single project may contain up to 20 client IDs. Learn more

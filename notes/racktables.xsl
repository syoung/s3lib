*******************************************************
RackTables (since 0.14.6) provides an automatic database upgrade feature.
If you already have a working installation, the following procedure
should be sufficient:

0. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE and check the release notes (below) before actually
   starting the upgrade,.
1. Remove all existing files except inc/secret.php and the gateways'
   configuration (in the gateways directory).
2. Unpack the new tarball into the place.
3. Open your RackTables page in a browser. The software detects version
   mismatch and displays a message telling to log in as admin to finish
   the upgrade.
4. Do that. Normally, everything should be Ok. If there are
   errors displayed, send these in a bug report.

<entry [Sun 2013:09:29 14:55:20 EST] RACKTABLES REST API>

REST/YAML RACKTABLES API
http://sjoeboo.github.io/blog/2012/05/31/getting-racktables-location-info-into-puppet/

    A script, running from cron, reading the racktables database and spitting out YAML documents of the data on a per host basis.

        Now, we can query the nice puppet/forman apiâ€™s for location data! Better yet, I can use these with storedconfigs to do things like add location info to Ganglia! Or have systems in 1 data center get specific configs (dns? puppet master? AD?)

        Our config management system is now location aware!

Build a RESTful API for RackTables
posted by Philip Durbin 
pdurbin@fas.harvard.edu

RackTables is a PHP webapp that lets system administrators describe where their servers are within a rack and a datacenter.

To see RackTables in action log in as admin/admin to http://racktables.org/demo.php and click around a datacenter.

RackTables has something of a server-side API at http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/racktables/index.php?title=RackTablesDevelGuide#API but it is not well suited to client-side, RESTful queries (such as the Twitter API). The need for such an API has been recognized on the RackTables mailing list at http://www.freelists.org/post/racktables-users/api-question and I'm aware of at least two department at Harvard that use RackTables and would benefit from an API.

A read-only API would be a great first step. Given a hostname, the API could return the datacenter, rack, and rack unit(s) in which a server resides, for example.

2012-05-12 update: A colleague of mine wrote an API that we're now using: http://blog.mattynick.com/blog/2012/05/31/getting-racktables-location-info-into-puppet/ . See also some discussion at http://www.freelists.org/post/racktables-users/RESTful-API-for-RackTables

2012-06-25 update: Ian Bettinger from Topsy Labs is working on a restful web service API for Racktables and hopes to merge his code into the main branch http://www.freelists.org/post/racktables-users/writing-a-restful-API-in-php-for-Racktables

2012-07-13 update: Ian has asked for feedback on some preliminary code (api.php - http://cache.gmane.org//gmane/comp/misc/racktables/user/1766-001.bin ) with this accompanying message: http://www.freelists.org/post/racktables-users/writing-a-restful-API-in-php-for-Racktables,11

2012-09-24 update: Ian Bettinger has published his code to https://github.com/ibettinger/racktables and issues can be filed at https://github.com/ibettinger/racktables/issues

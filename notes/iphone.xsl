Use the iPhone With MetroPCS
Though AT&T is the only official service provider for Apple's iPhone, if you "unlock" your iPhone, which entails downloading an application onto it that allows you to use it with any carrier, you can choose to use it with another wireless service provider, including MetroPCS, that offers contract-free service. The nature of the tasks involved is simple, although completing all of them will require diligence on your part.

Instructions
1
Unlock your iPhone. Point your browser to blackra1n.com and download the software package that corresponds to your computer's operating system. Install the software onto your computer and run it once the installation process has completed. Connect your iPhone to your computer using the USB cable that came with it and click the "Make It Rain" button within "blackra1n." Wait a few moments for "blackra1n" to install itself onto your iPhone, which will cause your iPhone to power off and restart. Tap the "blackra1n" icon on your iPhone and then the "Sn0w" icon within "blackra1n"--doing so will unlock your iPhone so that it can be used with any carrier.

2
Take your iPhone to a MetroPCS store to "flash" it so that it can work on the MetroPCS network. The "MetroFLASH" procedure costs $10 per phone as of October 2010.

3
Sign up for a MetroPCS account if you have not already done so. Speak with the associate at the store when you take your phone to get flashed to begin the process.

4
Transfer existing MetroPCS service to your iPhone by calling MetroPCS Customer Service at 1-888-863-8768. Turn off your old MetroPCS phone before beginning the process, as it will transmit signal to the MetroPCS tower and disrupt the transfer process. Inform the agent that you want to transfer service, making sure to keep your iPhone's IMEI serial number--a 15-digit number you can find in the "About" tab of the "Settings" menu--on hand, as the representative will need this to transfer your service.

<entry [Wed 2012:12:12 10:23:34 EST] USE UBUNTU ONE TO SYNC IPHONE CONTACTS>





http://maketecheasier.com/sync-iphone-contacts-to-ubuntu-one/2010/06/28

new Ubuntu One Contact [iTunes link] iPhone app, it is easy to sync your iPhone (contact) with your Ubuntu machine.


Configuring the iPhone-Ubuntu One synchronization

Before you install the iPhone app and start the synchronization, you will need to register for a phone synchronization account.

1. Go to http://one.ubuntu.com and login into your Ubuntu One account. If you do not have an Ubuntu One account, this is also the time to sign up for one.

2. Once you are logged in, go to https://one.ubuntu.com/phones/.



Choose Apple as the manufacturers and iPhone as the model. Click Choose.

3. You will be issued an username and password. Record it down. You will need this info to login to the mobile app later on.



4. Next, install Ubuntu One Contact from the app store on your iPhone/iPod Touch.

5. Activate the app. When prompted, enter your Ubuntu One Phone account login credential.



6. Back to the app main screen, tap on the big Sync Contacts icon to start the synchronization (you will need to connect to the Web for the synchronization to start).



The synchronization will now take place. You won’t see the synced contact in your Ubuntu One folder. Instead, log in to the web-based dashboard and click on the Contact tab, you should be able to see your contact list.



If you decided that you don’t want to do any more synchronization, you can remove the phone from your Ubuntu One account via the Edit Phone Setting link.



One way or two way sync?

In the Settings pane within the app, there are several preferences that you can set. The more important one is the ability to specify whether a one-way sync or two way sync should be made. You can specify to do a two way sync, or just phone -> Server, or vice-versa.



Currently, the Ubuntu One Contact app only syncs your iPhone contact, but I believe that in the future, it could extend its service to your Notes, emails, SMS or even your call log.

What do you like to sync most with this Ubuntu One mobile app?

<entry [Wed 2012:12:12 07:58:17 EST] SYNCed IPHONE CONTACTS TO UBUNTU>

NB: More information about interfacing iDevices to Linux:

http://www.libimobiledevice.org


1. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

sudo apt-get install git python-imobiledevice python-plist

MAY NEED TO INSTALL python-lxml AS WELL:

sudo apt-get install git python-imobiledevice python-plist python-lxml


2. DOWNLOAD python-idevicesync

git clone http://cgit.sukimashita.com/python-idevicesync.git/
cd python-idevicesync


3. CONNECT IPHONE

Connect your phone via USB: Ubuntu should auto-mount the device


4. SYNC CONTACTS

Download the contacts to a vCard file

./iphonesync.py -o Data.vCard com.apple.Contacts

Data.vCard now contains all the contacts from your phone.


5. UPLOAD TO GOOGLE CONTACTS


6. IMPORT (addresses AND phone numbers) INTO TO THUNDERBIRD

http://nic-nac-project.de/~kaosmos/morecols-en.html

A) install the extension MoreFunctionsForAddressBook because Thunderbird does not support the vcard format by default.

B) change the -o paramater when calling the script, so that a ".vcf" file is created:

./iphonesync.py -o Data.vcf com.apple.Contacts

This can then be imported into Thunderbird by calling up the Addressbook (Tools -> Address Book) and then going to Tools -> MoreFunctionsForAddressBook -> Actions for Contacts -> Import vCard/vcf and selecting the file.

All contacts will then be imported into the "Personal Address Book" of Thunderbird.


6. SYNCHRONISE FULL ADDRESS BOOK ON Google Contacts TO NEW IPHONE

DOWNLOAD IPHONE CONTACTS TO LINUX

Motivation: My Macbook Pro from 2006/2007 quit working and I needed to get all the contacts off my iPhone and onto my new HTC G2.  You can’t just plug the phone into a windows machine and use iTunes to do a backup because the phone was formatted for OSX.  Ubuntu One can sync the contacts but that costs money, as do most of the other contact synchronization apps in the iPhone market.

Requirements:

Ubuntu Linux
Python
libplist
libiphone
git
python-idevicesync
Steps:

Install the required libraries

sudo apt-get install git python-imobiledevice python-plist
Download the python-idevicesync script

git clone http://cgit.sukimashita.com/python-idevicesync.git/
cd python-idevicesync
Connect your phone via USB: Ubuntu should auto-mount the device

Download the contacts to a vCard file

./iphonesync.py -o Data.vCard com.apple.Contacts
Data.vCard now contains all the contacts from your phone.  You can then upload that file to Google Contacts and edit it to your liking. Now that I have my full address book on Google Contacts I can just use that to synchronize to my new phone.

Conclusion:

Exactly what I wanted.  More information about interfacing iDevices to Linux can be found here:  http://www.libimobiledevice.org

Interestingly enough, after the fact I realized that my friend’s brother runs the site… small world.
